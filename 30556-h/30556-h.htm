<h2>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>Psychoanalysis holds a key to the problem of sleep walking,
which alone has been able to unlock the mysteries of its causes and
its significance. This key is the principle of wish fulfilment, an
interpretative principle which explains the mechanisms of the
psyche and illuminates the mental content which underlies these.
Sleep walking as a method of wish fulfilment evidently lies close
to the dream life, which has become known through psychoanalysis.
Most of us when we dream, according to the words of Protagoras,
&ldquo;lie still, and do not stir.&rdquo; In some persons there is however a special
tendency to motor activity, in itself a symptomatic manifestation,
which necessitates the carrying out of the dream wish through
walking in the sleep. The existence of this fact, together with
the evidence of an influence of the shining of the moon upon this
tendency to sleep walking, give rise to certain questions of importance
to medical <ins title="pschology">psychology</ins>. The author of this book has pursued
these questions in relation to cases which have come to him for
psychoanalysis, in the investigation of actual records of sleep walking
given in literature and in the study of rare instances where
it has been made the subject of a literary production or at least an
episode in tale or drama. In each case the association with moonlight
or some other light has been a distinct feature.</p>

<p>The author's application of psychoanalysis to these problems
has the directness and explicitness which we are accustomed to
find in Freud's own writings. This is as true in the literary portion
of the work as in the medical but it never intrudes to mar the
intrinsic beauty of certain of the selections nor the force of the
intuitive revelations which the writers of <ins title="these">the</ins> preceding science
have made in regard to sleep walking and walking in the moonlight.
Sadger has skilfully utilized these revelations to convince us of
the truth of the psychoanalytic discoveries and has used the latter
only to make still more explicitly and scientifically clear the testimony
of the poetic writers and to point out the applicability of their
material to medical problems. The choice of this little understood
and little studied subject and its skilful presentation on the part
of the author, as well as the introduction to the reader of the literary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi">vi</a></span>productions of which use has been made, give the book a peculiar
interest and value. It is also of especial service in its brief but
profoundly suggestive study of the psychic background of Shakespeare's
creative work as illustrated in the sleep walking of Lady
Macbeth. The endeavor in the translation has been to make accessible
to our English readers the clear and direct psychoanalysis of
the author and the peculiar psychologic and literary value of the
book.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION<a name="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<p>Sleep walking or night wandering, known also by its Latin name
of noctambulism, is a well-known phenomenon. Somnambulism is
not so good a term for it, since that signifies too many things. In
sleep walking a person rises from his bed in the night, apparently
asleep, walks around with closed or half opened eyes, but without
perceiving anything, yet performs all sorts of apparently purposeful
and often quite complicated actions and gives correct answers
to questions, without afterward the least knowledge of what he has
said or done. If this all happens at the very time and under the influence
of the full moon, it is spoken of as moon walking or being
moonstruck.</p>

<p>Under the influence of this heavenly body the moonstruck individual
is actually enticed from his bed, often gazes fixedly at the
moon, stands at the window or climbs out of it, &ldquo;with the surefootedness
of the sleep walker,&rdquo; climbs up upon the roof and walks
about there or, without stumbling, goes into the open. In short, he
carries out all sorts of complex actions. Only it would be dangerous
to call the wanderer by name, for then he would not only
waken where he was, but he would collapse frequently and fall
headlong with fright if he found himself on a height.</p>

<p>Besides there is absolute amnesia succeeding this. Upon persistent
questioning there is an attempt to fill in the gaps in memory
by confabulation, like the effort to explain posthypnotic action.
Furthermore, it is asserted that a specially deep sleep always ushers
in night wandering, that indeed the latter in general is only possible
in this condition. It is more frequent with children up to puberty
and throughout that period than with adults. At the same time the
first outbreak of sleep walking occurs often at the first appearance
of sexual maturity. According to a widespread folk belief sleep
walking will cease in a girl when she becomes pregnant with her
first child.</p>

<p>It seems to me that practically no scientific treatment of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii">viii</a></span>problem exists. Modern psychiatry, so far as it takes a sort of general
notice of it, contents itself, as Krafft-Ebing does, with calling
night wandering &ldquo;a nervous disease,&rdquo; &ldquo;apparently a symptomatic
manifestation of other neuroses, epilepsy, hysteria, status nervosus.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The older literature is more explicit. It produces not only a
full casuistic but seeks to give some explanation aside from a
reference to neurology.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> So, for example, the safety in climbing
upon dangerous places finds this explanation, that the sleep walker
goes there with closed eyes and in this way does not see the danger,
knows no giddiness and above all is in possession of a specially keen
muscular sense.</p>

<p>The phenomena of sleep walking and moon walking must be
acknowledged, as far as I can see, almost entirely as pathological
yet connected or identical with analogous manifestations of normal
profound sleep. The dreams in such sleep, in contrast with those of
light sleep, are characterized by movements. These often amount
merely to speaking out, laughing, weeping, smacking, throwing oneself
about and so on, or occasionally to complicated actions,
which begin with leaving the bed. Further comparison shows the
night wandering as symptomatically similar to hysterical and hypnotic
somnambulism. This interpretation might be objected to upon
the ground that unfortunately we know nothing of the origin of the
motor phenomena of the dream and that understanding of the hysterical
and hypnotic somnambulism is deplorably lacking. Still less
has science to say about the influence of the moon upon night wandering.
The authors extricate themselves from the difficulty by
simply denying its influence. They bring forward as their chief
argument for this that many sleep walkers are subject to their attacks
as frequently in dark as in moonlight nights and when
sleeping in rooms into which no beam of moonlight can penetrate.
Spitta indeed explains it thus: &ldquo;The much discussed and romantically
treated &lsquo;moon walking&rsquo; is a legend which stands in contradiction
to hitherto observed facts. That the phantasy of the German
folk mind drew to itself the pale ghostly light of the moon and
could reckon from it all sorts of wonderful things, proves nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix">ix</a></span>to us.&rdquo; I can only say here that ten negative cases signify nothing
in the face of a single positive one and a thousand-fold experience
undoubtedly represents a certain connection between the light of
the full moon and the most complicated forms of sleep walking.</p>

<p>Not merely does science avoid these things on account of their
strangeness, but also the poets best informed in the things of the
soul, whom the problems of night wandering and moon walking
should stimulate. From the entire province of artistic literature I can
mention only Shakespeare's &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; Kleist's &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Prinz von Homburg</span>,&rdquo;
the novel &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Maria</span>&rdquo; by Otto Ludwig, &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Sündkind</span>&rdquo; by
Anzengruber, &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jörn Uhl</span>&rdquo; by Gustav Frenssen and &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aebelö</span>&rdquo; by
Sophus Michaelis.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Finally Ludwig Ganghofer has briefly sketched
his own sleep walking in his autobiographical &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lebenslauf eines
Optimisten</span>,&rdquo; and Ludwig Tieck has given unrestrained expression to
his passionate love toward this heavenly body in different portions
of his works.</p>

<p>Only in &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Maria</span>&rdquo; and in &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aebelö</span>&rdquo; however do these themes
play an important part, while in the other works mentioned they
serve properly only as adornment and episodic ornament. I am not
able to explain this unusual restraint, unless we accept the fact that
our best poets shrink from touching upon questions which they
themselves can so little understand.</p>

<p>It has been expected that the psychoanalytic method, which
casts such light upon the unconscious, might do much to advance the
understanding of the problems of sleep walking and moon walking.
But unfortunately no one undergoes such an expensive and time-consuming
treatment as psychoanalysis for moon walking, so that
the hoped for illumination can come at the best only as a by-product
in the psychoanalysis of neurotics. That has in fact been my good
fortune twice, where I have been able to lift the curtain, though
only a little, in two cases among my patients and also in individuals
who were otherwise healthy. What I discovered there, I will relate
in detail in what follows.</p>

<p>One point of view I will first set forth. Two questions appear
to me to stand out among those closely bound with our theme.
First on the motor side. Why does not the sleep walker, who is enjoying
apparently a specially deep slumber, sleep on quietly and
work out the complexes of his unconscious somehow in a dream,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x">x</a></span>even though with speech or movement there? Why instead is he
urged forth and driven to wander about and engage in all sorts of
complicated acts? It is one of the most important functions of the
dream to prolong sleep quietly. And then in the second place, What
value and significance must be attributed to the moon and its light?
These two chief questions must be answered by any theory that
would do justice to the question of sleep walking and moon walking.</p>

<span class="smcap">Medical</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Case I.</span> Some years ago I treated a hysterical patient, exceedingly
erotic. She was at that time twenty-two years old, and on her
father's as well as on the mother's side, from a very degenerate
family. Alcoholism and epilepsy could be traced with certainty to
the third ascendant on both sides. The father's sister is mentally
diseased, the patient's mother was an enuretic in her earlier years
and a sleep walker. This mother, like her father when he was
drunk, was markedly cruel and given to blows, characteristics, which
according to our patient, sometimes almost deprived her of her
senses and in her anger bordered upon frenzy.</p>

<p>The patient herself had been as the youngest child the spoiled
darling of both parents and until her seventh year had been taken
by them into their bed in the morning to play. In her first three
years she always slept between the parents, preferably on the inner
side of one of the two beds and with her legs spread, so that, in her
mother's words: &ldquo;One foot belongs to me and one to her father!&rdquo;
She was most strongly drawn, however, to the mother, toward whom
at an early age she was sexually stimulated, already in her first year,
if her statements can be relied upon, when she sat upon her mother's
lap while nursing.</p>

<p>The little one early learned also that, when one is sick, one receives
new playthings and especially much petting and tenderness,
on account of which she often pretended to be sick purposely or she
phantasied about dark forms and ugly faces, which of course she
never saw, except to compel the mother to stay with her and show
her special love and tenderness. Already in her second year she
would go to bed most dutifully, &ldquo;right gladly&rdquo; to please father and
mother and gain sexual pleasure thereby. The father then let her
ride on his knee, stroked her upon her buttocks and kissed her passionately
upon the lips. The desire after the mother became the
stronger. When the latter had lain down and the little one had been
good, then the child would creep to the mother under the feather
bed and snuggle close to her body (&ldquo;wind herself fast like a serpent&rdquo;).
The mother's firm body gave her extraordinary pleasure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2">2</a></span>yes, not infrequently it led to the expulsion of a secretion from the
cervix uteri. (&ldquo;The good comes,&rdquo; as she expressed it.) I mention
convulsive attacks and enuresis nocturna, as pathological affections
of her childhood which belong to my theme. The patient had
in fact suffered in her first year a concussion of the brain, through
being thrown against a brick wall, with organic eclamptic attacks as
a result. The great love which she had experienced because of this
led her also later to imitate those attacks hysterically. In the fourth
year, for example, when she had to sleep in a child's crib, no longer
between the beloved parents, she immediately produced attacks of
anxiety in which she saw ugly faces and witches as in the beginning
of the eclamptic convulsions. Thereupon the frightened mother
took her again into her own bed. Later also she often began to
moan and fret until the mother would take her in her arms to ward
off the threatened attacks, and thus she could stimulate herself to
her heart's content. As she reports, at the height of the orgasm she
expelled a secretion, her body began to writhe convulsively, her face
became red as fire, her eyes rolled about and she almost lost herself
in her great pleasure.</p>

<p>Concerning her enuresis, in its relation to urethral eroticism, the
patient relates the following: &ldquo;When I pressed myself against my
mother's or brother's thigh, not only &lsquo;the good&rsquo; came, but frequently
also urine with it. At about eight years old there was often a very
strong compulsion to urinate, especially at night, which would cause
me to wet my bed. This was however according to my wish to pass
not urine but that same secretion which I had voided at two or three
years old, when I became so wildly excited with my mother, that is
when, lying in bed with her, I pressed her thigh between mine. I
could not stop it in spite of all threats or punishments. Very curiously
I usually awoke when I voided urine, but I could not retain
it in the face of the great pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I lay emphasis upon a specially strong homosexual tendency<a name="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
among her various perversions, although she had the usual sex relations
with a legion of men with complete satisfaction. Furthermore,
as sadistic-masochistic traits, there was an abnormal pleasure in giving
and receiving blows and a passionate desire for blood. It was a
sexual excitement that occurred when she saw her own blood or
that of others. I have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> described this blood sadism and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3">3</a></span>will refer here to only two features, which are of significance also
in regard to her moon walking. The first is her greatly exaggerated
vaginal eroticism, which at menstruation especially was abnormally
pleasurably excited. The second, on the other hand, was that our
patient already at the age of two years should have experienced
sexual pleasure in the mother's hemoptysis. Sitting on the mother's
lap she stimulated herself upon the latter's breast, when she began
to scrape and then to cough up blood. She reached after her bloody
lips in order afterward to lick off her own fingers. As a result of
the sexual overexcitement which occurred then, blood has afforded
her enormous pleasure ever since, when she has looked upon it.</p>

<p>As for the rest of her life, I will refer to two other points only,
which are not without importance for our problem. First of all was
the change of dwelling after the father's death in our patient's
seventh year. The other is her burning desire, arising in her third
or fourth year, to play mother and most eagerly with a real live
child. A baby doll, of which she came into possession, was only a
substitute, although for want of something better she carried this
around passionately and did not once lay it out of her arms while
asleep. At the age of eight it was her greatest delight to trudge
around with a small two year old girl from the house and sing her
to sleep as her mother had once done to her. &ldquo;Carrying that child
around was my greatest delight until I was fourteen years old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I mentioned above that her mother had been sadistic and at
the same time a sleep walker. &ldquo;Mother herself told me that she
also rather frequently walked at night. As a child she would wander
around in her room without being able to find her bed again.
Over and over again she would pass it without finding her way into
it. Then she would begin to cry loudly with fright for her bed
until Grandmother awoke and lifted her into bed. In the morning
she remembered nothing at all about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the same way with her desire to urinate. Every night
she had a frightful need to urinate and hunted for the chamber,
but, although it always stood in its accustomed place, she was not
able to find it. Meanwhile the desire grew more severe, so that she
began moaning fearfully in her sleep while hunting. She sought
all over the room, even crept around under the bed without touching
or noticing the chamber, which was there. Often she did not
then return to her bed until Grandmother was awakened by her
moans, brought her what she wanted and helped her to bed. It
happened rather frequently that, because of the very great need, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4">4</a></span>wet the bed or the room while on her search, whereupon naturally
a whipping followed. Sometimes she lay quite quiet later on
in her sleep, but when she could not find her bed, was obliged to
pass half the night in the cold room. Once when I myself wet my
bed, she struck me with the words: &lsquo;Every time that this happens
you will be whipped; my mother whipped me for this reason&rsquo;  Although
she knew from her own experience that it could not be
helped, yet she struck me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides the moon exercised a great power over my mother.
Since the house in which she lived was low and stood out in the
open country, and there were no window blinds, on bright moonlight
nights the moon shone into the farthest corner. In the corner
stood a box, on which were a number of flower pots, figures and
glass covers. Upon this box she climbed, after she had first taken
down one object after another and placed them on the floor without
breaking anything. Then she began to dance upon the top of
the box, but only on bright moonlight nights. Finally she put everything
back in exactly the same place to a hair's breadth and climbed
out of the window, but not before she had removed there a number
of flower pots out of the way. From the window she reached the
court where she rambled about, climbed over the garden fence and
walked around at least an hour. Then she went back, arranged the
flowers on the window in exact order and&mdash;could not find her way to
bed. There was always a scene the next day if Grandmother had
been wakened in the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The most noteworthy feature in this statement, beside the
phenomenon of sadism, later taken over by the daughter, the urethral
eroticism and the susceptibility toward the moonlight, is the behavior
of the mother while walking in her sleep. She plainly has
an idea where the flower pots stand, which she removes from the
box and the window, but on the other hand she comes in contact
neither with the bed nor the chamber, which yet are in their usual
places. We will also take note further on of the dancing upon the
box in the bright moonlight as well as the climbing out of the window,
climbing and walking about.</p>

<p>Before I go on with my patient's story, something should be said
concerning its origin. She had been undergoing psychoanalytic
treatment with me for nine months on account of various severe
hysterical symptoms, which I will not here touch upon further, when
she one day came out with the proposal that she write for me her
autobiography. I agreed to it and she brought me little by little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5">5</a></span>about two hundred fifty pages of folio, which she had prepared
without any influence on my part, except of course that she had, in
those months of treatment, made the technique of the analysis very
much her own as far as it touched upon her case. Practically nothing
in our work together in solving her difficulties was said of her
sleep walking. I have also in no way influenced or been able to influence
her explanation. It originates solely from the patient's associations
and the employment of her newly acquired knowledge of
the unconscious in the interpretation of her symptoms.</p>

<p>I find then in her account of her life some highly interesting
points. &ldquo;Even at two or three years old Mother at my entreaties
must soothe me to sleep. As we lay together in bed I pretended
often to be asleep and reached as if &lsquo;in my sleep&rsquo; after my mother's
breast in order to revel in sensation there. Also I often uncovered
myself, again ostensibly in my sleep, and laid myself down quite
contentedly. Then I awoke my mother by coughing, and when she
awoke she stroked me and fondled me, and as was her custom kissed
me also upon the genitals. Frequently I stood up in bed between
my parents&mdash;a forerunner of my later sleep walking&mdash;and laid
myself down at my mother's feet, asleep as she thought, but in
reality awake only with eyes closed. Then I pulled the feather bed
away from Mother and blinked at her in order to see her naked
body, which I could do better from the foot than if I had lain near
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she awoke she took me up to my place, kissed me repeatedly
over my whole body and covered me up. I opened my eyes then as
if just awakening, she kissed me on the eyes and said I should go
quietly to sleep again, which I then did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still earlier, at one or two years, I pretended to be asleep when
my parents went to bed, that I might obtain caresses, because Father
and Mother always said, &lsquo;See, how dear, what a little angel!&rsquo; They
kissed me then and I opened my eyes as if waking from deep sleep.
This was the first time that I pretended to be asleep. I often lay
thus for a long time apparently asleep but really awake. For when
the parents saw that I was asleep, they told one another all sorts of
things about us children. Especially Mother often spoke of my
fine traits, or that people praised me and found me &lsquo;so dear&rsquo; which
she never said in my presence lest she should make me vain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here is an early preceding period when the little one deliberately
pretends to be asleep in order to hear loving things, receive
caresses and experience sexual activity without having to be held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6">6</a></span>accountable or to be afraid of receiving punishment, because everything
happens in sleep. In the same way similar erotic motives and
<ins title="analagous">analogous</ins> behavior may be found in the account of her other actions
while asleep. As she began to talk at two years old her parents
begged her to tell everything that had happened to her, for example
in the absence of either of them. She must tell to the minutest detail,
when she awoke early lying between her parents, what had
happened to her during the day before, what she had done with her
brothers and sisters, what had taken place for her at school, and so
on. She responded so much the more gladly, because in narrating
all this she could excite herself more or less as well upon the father's
as upon the mother's body.</p>

<p>In fact, this was the very source of a direct compulsion to have
to tell things, from which she often had to suffer frightfully. The
very bigoted mother sent her regularly from her sixth year on
with her sister to the preaching services with the express injunction
to report the sermons at home. And although on account of
her poor head she had to struggle grievously with every poem or
bit of lesson which she had to learn for school, yet now at home she
would seat herself upon a hassock, spread a handkerchief over
her shoulders and begin to drone out the whole sermon as she had
heard it in the church from the minister. And this all merely out
of love for her mother! Furthermore she was, according to her
own words, directly in love with her teacher in the school, who often
struck her on account of her inattentiveness and certainly did not
treat her otherwise with fondness. Here is a motive for the later
learning, singing and reciting of poetry during the sleep walking,
while the pleasure in being struck when at fault was increased by
self reproach, that she in spite of all her pains was so bad at
learning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During my whole childhood,&rdquo; the patient states, &ldquo;I talked a
great deal in my sleep. When I had a task to learn by heart, I said
over the given selection or the poem in my sleep. This happened
the first time when I was eight years old, on a bright moonlight
night. I was sleeping at the time in the bed with my sister and I
arose in the night, recited a poem and sang songs. At about the
same period, standing on a chair or on the bed, I repeated parts of
sermons which I had heard the day before at church. Besides I
prattled about everything which I had done the previous day or
about my play. How often I was afraid that I would divulge something
from my sexual play with my brother! That must never have
happened, however, or mother would have mentioned it to me, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7">7</a></span>she always told me everything that I said during the night.&rdquo; I
might perhaps sum up this activity in her sleep after this fashion:
Day and night she is studying for the beloved but unresponsive
teacher and strives to win and to keep her good will as well as that
of the mother through the repeating of sermons and relating of all
the events of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for the talking in my sleep, I began at the age of two or
three, though awake, to pretend to be asleep and to speak out as if
asleep. For example I acted as if I were tormented with frightful
dreams and cried out with great terror, ostensibly in a dream:
&lsquo;Mother, Mother, take me!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Stay with me!&rsquo; or something of the
sort. Then Mother took me, as I had anticipated, under her feather
bed and quieted me, but I naturally became excited while I pressed
my legs about her body presumably from fear of witches and immediately
there occurred a &lsquo;convulsive attack,&rsquo; that is I now experienced
such lustful pleasure that &lsquo;the good&rsquo; came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attention may further be called to the fact that she threw herself
about violently in her sleep, which caused her, as the daughter
of so brutal a mother, who was herself a sado-masochist, an excessive
amount of pleasurable sensation. When only two or three
years old, as she lay between the parents, she pushed them with
hands and feet, of which she was quite conscious, while they thought
it happened in sleep. This brought the advantage that she was not
responsible for anything which happened in sleep, for it occurred
when she was in an unconscious condition.</p>

<p>The changing of the home in her seventh year, after the death
of the father, led to her sharing the bed of her sister six years older
than she. &ldquo;My sister had the habit of throwing off the covers in
her sleep or twisting her legs about mine. I, on the other hand,
always hit her in my sleep with hands or feet. Naturally I could
not help it since it actually happened while I was asleep, yet when
my sister could stand it no longer I had to go and lie with Mother.
I also struck her in my sleep. Besides I nestled up against her body,
especially her buttocks, and experienced very pleasurable excitement.
For it was simply impossible with her strong body and in
the narrow bed to avoid touching my mother. Only I did it to her
quite consciously, but she was of the impression that I pressed upon
her in my sleep because I had no room in bed. The reason that I
as a small child pushed against my parents in bed was simply the
wish to be able to strike them once to my heart's desire, and since
this was impossible during the day, I did it while asleep, when no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8">8</a></span>one is responsible for what one does. Striking my sister then actually
in my sleep, when I was seven years old, was again the wish to
be able to excite myself pleasurably by the blows as when a smaller
child.&rdquo; Here her sadism again breaks through in this desire to
strike mother and sister according to her heart's desire and it especially
excited her because of her constitutionally exaggerated muscle
erotic. I have discussed this sadism at length elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It can be affirmed, if we examine her behavior in sleep, that without
exception sexual wishes lay at the bottom of it, just as the dream
also, as is well known, always represents the fulfilment of infantile
wishes. The plainly erotic character is never wanting in an apparently
asexual action, if we penetrate it more deeply. So for example
this patient repeated the sermon at her mother's bidding in
order to receive her love and praise. Saying her lessons at night
arose from her strong attachment to her teacher, which again in
turn was a stage of her love for her mother. Naturally this was
all concerned with wishes, which, strictly tabooed when awake, could
only be gratified in unconsciousness, somehow carried out in sleep,
or, as with the simulated convulsions, only in the mother's bed. The
behavior during sleep served especially well to grant sexual pleasure
but without guilt or liability to punishment.</p>

<p>It was quite in order further that a conscious activity preceded
the unconscious activity in sleep, that is, that for a time the patient
while awake, but with closed eyes and therefore apparently asleep,
did the very thing which later was done in actual unconsciousness.
What then impressed itself as an unconscious performance during
sleep, had been earlier done consciously, almost I might say as &ldquo;a
studied action.&rdquo; Only in special cases is there any need for playing
such a comedy, for the direct demand of a beloved individual&mdash;&ldquo;You
must tell everything,&rdquo; &ldquo;You must learn diligently,&rdquo; &ldquo;Repeat
the sermon accurately,&rdquo;&mdash;when the eroticism is well concealed, permits
of open action without more hindrance. It may be noted
further that the patient never betrayed in the least in her sleep what
she must have been at pains carefully to conceal, as, for example, the
sexual play with her brother. Finally the striking participation of
the muscle erotic at times in sleep must be emphasized.</p>

<p>We have found already as roots and motives of her sleep activity
sexual, strongly forbidden wishes, which particularly could often
be gratified only in bed; the striving that she might commit
misdemeanor without being held guilty or answerable; further the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9">9</a></span>practicing of these things first while awake; and finally, as an organic
root, at least the pleasure in blows in sleep, the undeniably
exaggerated muscle erotic. Nearly everything takes place in bed,
only occasionally outside it, and then always near it. Complicated
actions are completely wanting. Likewise nothing was said of the
influence of the light or of the moon. Only in passing was it mentioned
that the patient arose in the moonlight for her first nightly
recitation of lessons.</p>

<p>The group of phenomena which we will now take up displays
complicated performances and stands above all under the evident
influence of the light of the moon. &ldquo;In my fourth year,&rdquo; the patient
relates, &ldquo;I was put for the first time into a little bed of my own, so
that my mother, who the day before had begun to cough up blood,
should have more rest. She had closed the net of my crib and that
I should not be frightened moved the crib up to her large bed. I
pretended to be asleep and as soon as my parents had fallen asleep
I climbed over the side but was so unfortunate as to fall into my
mother's bed. I was quickly laid back in my own bed, without having
seen the blood, which was my special longing. Often after
this, almost every night, I tried again to climb into Mother's bed,
so that finally she placed my bed by the wall in order to prevent my
climbing over to her. For some months I slept alone in my little
bed. She caught me one night, however, this time actually in my
sleep, trying to climb over the side but entangled in the net. Fortunately
I did not fall out but back into bed. At that time I produced
also my pretended convulsive attacks that I might be taken
by Mother into her bed and be able to excite myself upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother began raising blood again when I was ten years old and
we had already moved into the new home. That year she was
seized twice with such severe hemorrhages that for weeks she
hovered between life and death. Then in my eleventh year I began
my sleep walking. What urged me to it was again Mother's coughing
of blood as well as the desire to see her blood, both reasons why
I had already at four years old pretended sleep so that I could climb
into Mother's bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The patient proved herself such an ideal nurse on the occasion
of the mother's severe hemorrhage that the mother would have no
one else. She watched tirelessly day and night together with her
sisters, changing every few minutes the icebags which had been
ordered. &ldquo;Scarcely a moment did I tear myself away from my
mother's bedside and, if one of my sisters relieved me, I often could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10">10</a></span>hardly move, undress myself and lie down for an hour. If I did
lie down, I threw myself about restlessly, torn with anxiety, and
was only happy again when I sat by my mother's bed.&rdquo; This fearful
anxiety was not however merely fear for the precious life of
the mother, but still more, repressed libido. In spite of all her concern
for the mother's suffering she could not prevent the strongest
sexual pleasurable sensations at the sight of the mother's snow white
breast in putting on the applications or when she raised blood. This
intensive nursing lasted four weeks until finally a nursing Sister
came to assist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I now for the first time could enjoy a full night's rest, I
fell into a deep sleep, as from this time on I always did before every
sleep walking. Near my bed stood the table with Mother's medicine
and on the window ledge, behind the curtain, a lamp, which threw
its light upon my bed. Suddenly I arose in my sleep, went to my
mother's bed, bent over her. Mother opened her eyes but did not
rouse herself. Then the Sister, who was dozing on the sofa near
Mother's bed, awoke and rushed forward frightened as she saw me
there in my nightgown. She thought something had happened to
Mother, but the latter motioned with her hand to leave me alone and
to keep still. I kissed Mother and changed the icebag, apparently in
order to see her breast. I could see no blood this time, so without
a sound I moved away and went to the table, where I put all the
medicines carefully together to make a place and then went out into
the pitch dark kitchen without stumbling against anything. There I
took from the kitchen dresser a bowl with a saucer and a spoon and
came back again to the room. Next I seized a glass of water which
stood there and poured the water carefully into the bowl without
spilling more than a drop. With this I spoke out half aloud to myself:
&lsquo;Now Emil (my brother-in-law, who had for a long time taken
his breakfast with us) can come to his breakfast without disturbing
Mother, who had always prepared it for <ins title="him.">him.&rsquo;</ins> Then I went to bed
and slept soundly for some hours, as I sleep only at my periods of
sleep walking, without crying out. All that I have described the
Sister of Charity told me afterward. Naturally I did everything
with closed eyes, without knowing it, and moved about as securely
in the darkness as if it had been bright day. The next morning
they told me about it and laughed over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is what she has to say of the influence of the light upon her
sleep walking. &ldquo;Here also Mother's coughing was the external
cause as it had been when I was four years old. When Mother was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11">11</a></span>ill, the lamp was left upon the window sill behind the curtain, burning
brightly so that she would not be afraid. Now also, at the time
of my first complicated sleep walking, such a light was burning
behind the curtain throwing its light upon my bed and the wall.
Mother had always left the light burning in order to see me at once,
after I had sometimes climbed over the side of my crib at the age
of four, when she was ill. The light however made me climb over
to her, because in the dark no blood could be seen. Also when I
began to moan, during my convulsive attacks, she made a light and
came to my bed. Or she said, when my bed was pushed close to
hers: &lsquo;Wait a moment; I will make a light and take you or you can
climb over to me.&rsquo; Next day I laughed with my parents over my
visit at night, without suspecting that I would soon be repeating it
actually in my sleep. And it was only for this, that I might, as at
the very first time, enjoy the sight of Mother's blood. Now, when
she had a light burning during her illness, this allured me in my
sleep to climb out to her, as at that first time when she had made a
light especially for me to climb over to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following memory leads still deeper into the etiology:
&ldquo;Mother always had the habit of going from bed to bed, when we
children were asleep, and lighting us with her lamp to make sure
that we were asleep. I perceived the light in my sleep, which called
me to Mother. She had lighted me that first time so that I might
climb into bed with her. Now I thought in my sleep, when I saw
the light, that she was calling me again and she found me often at
the very point of climbing over to her. I see myself yet today with
one foot over the bars, almost in a riding position. Yet nothing
ever happened to me. A complete change took place within me when
the light of a candle or a lamp fell upon my face. I might almost
say that I experienced a great feeling of pleasure. I seemed to
myself in my sleep to be a supernatural being. I immediately perceived
the light even when I lay in deepest sleep. There was however
no sign of waking. This must represent a second form of <ins title="consciounsess">consciousness</ins>,
which possessed me at such times. I often asked my
mother all sorts of things while wandering about, always knew to
whom I spoke although I did not see the person and before I heard
anyone speak I already mentioned the person's name. My orientation
in sleep walking was so exact that I never once stubbed my toe
against anything. It was just so with urination, which was probably
connected with the moon or with a night light accidentally falling
upon me. As soon as I pressed out secretion or the urine came,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12">12</a></span>I found myself in a half sleep without being able to prevent an excessive
feeling of pleasure. Then first I came to myself. This
seems to me to go back to the fact that Mother often awoke me on
special occasions in the night, holding a lamp or a candle in her
hand to set me on the chamber, especially when she heard me moaning
in my sleep and suspected a convulsive attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In what follows a complete identification with the mother is reported
in detail. That has come in part to our notice in the first
sleep walking, when our patient prepares the breakfast for her
brother-in-law. &ldquo;After that first sleep walking when Mother was
having hemorrhages, they took place now rather frequently, when
the least glimmer of light fell upon me, when Mother, for instance,
lighted a candle at night to take some drops for her cough. Thus
it happened that almost every night, as long as our beds stood together,
I acted this little part. Often my family did not awaken and
yet we knew the next day, when something was missing, that I had
been the culprit in my sleep, as the next little example will show.</p>

<p>&rdquo;My greatest wish at that time, at ten years old, was to be
&lsquo;Mother&rsquo; and have a child that I might bring up as I pleased. One
morning when Mother got up and wished to dress herself she did
not find her underclothing. We sisters were still fast asleep and
Mother did not wish to waken us. She could remember exactly
that she had laid her clothing as she always did on the chair near her
bed. When she saw that search was in vain she put on fresh linen.
Fully an hour later I awoke and was completely astonished to find
myself dressed and in Mother's clothing. The puzzle was now
solved. The putting on of Mother's clothing during the sleep walking
had plainly been merely my wish to put myself into the mother's
place and also to play mother, as I did with the children day after
day. It was just at this time that I was always seeking to trail
around all day with children, whom I tormented, treated cruelly,
often even struck them for no cause whatever, always with a great
feeling of pleasure, as I myself fared at my mother's hands. It was
very frequently the case that I spread the table for a meal, in
Mother's place, or put on her linen or outer clothing. This happened
most often when she was ill again with her cough or the light
shone upon me in my sleep. The light of the candle was sufficient
for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At thirteen years she began to be directly affected by the moonlight.
&ldquo;At that time I had to sleep in a small room which <ins title="by">my</ins> brother
had occupied before this. This room looked out upon the court and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13">13</a></span>was, especially on the nights when the moon was full, as bright as
if a lamp were burning in the room. I was very much afraid to
sleep alone in a room. This was the first time in my life that it had
happened. I feared that in every corner some one might be standing
and suddenly step forth or might lie hidden behind the bed and
although I first let the candle light shine over everything, I had no
rest but was in continual fear. I slept here perhaps only fourteen
days in all, but it was full moon just at this time and rather bright
in the small room.</p>

<p><ins title="Before">&ldquo;Before</ins> going to sleep I always barred the door of the room,
which near the other door of our house opened upon a small passage.
On account of the shop we lived on an upper floor. When
I lay in bed I was always thinking that I had not bolted the door
well and every night I arose three or four times before going to
sleep in order to make sure whether I had actually bolted the door
carefully. This I did while awake. Finally I fell asleep. I knew
nothing in the morning of what happened in the night. Yet for
several days, when I arose in the morning, I found the door which
led out of my room upon the passage standing open. I must also
have gone about the house during the night, at least have been in
the passage. It alarmed Mother and, when early the next day the
door was once more open, she said that I need never sleep alone
again. I had not had the remotest thought that she would watch me
the next night. As usual she could, when I talked in my sleep, ask
me about everything and obtain correct answers without wakening
me. If however she called my name in fright, when I was walking,
as in the scene about to be described, then I awoke. Some nights
apparently I roamed about in the house, God knows where, in the
moonlight, without any one noticing it. Now it was the window in
the passage, which looked into the court and was always closed at
night, that was left open. What took place there I cannot say, since
no one observed me. I can however describe clearly what my
mother saw happen and which she told me afterward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I lay down I tried the door several times to see if it were
securely bolted, then slept until about twelve o'clock. Between
twelve and one o'clock, when I as a child had always been most
afraid because this was a ghostly hour, my mother, who compelled
herself this night to remain awake, heard my door creak slightly.
She watched and saw the following: I went out in my nightgown
softly to the door and to the window on the passage, which I opened.
I swung myself upon that rather high window and remained there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14">14</a></span>a while without moving, sitting there while I gazed straight at the
moon. Then&mdash;it seemed to my mother like an eternity&mdash;I climbed
down softly and went quietly along the passage into the first story.
Half way along however I considered, turned back and went into
my room. Having reached the door I turned once again and went
along the passage to the door of the court. This was fastened.
Again I turned and now went to the house gate. There I remained
standing. I even tried to open it, as if I heard my name called.
Then I was frightened, looked about me and was awake. Shaking
with cold, for I was there half naked, I could scarcely orient myself.
Then I crept to my bed and slept without waking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This happened in the second week. Every morning my door
was open so that I had to sleep again in Mother's room. The moon
never shone in there and the night light was covered. Nevertheless
the sleep walking began also in this room in two weeks, if only
the light of the candle fell upon me in my sleep. More often I
lighted the candle myself in my sleep and went around in the room
and the kitchen. Sometimes Mother found me standing by the door
of the shop apparently about to open it and walk out. Now I have
frequently, when I am lying in bed, the desire to spring out of the
window, or to open both casements to get air for I am often afraid
of choking. Mother had often felt this way in her illness. It also
happened that Mother found me sitting by my chest, where I was
looking for something which I had needed the day before and intended
looking for the next day. I had laid out all my possessions
about me. If Mother called me by name, I awoke; if she did not
call me but only spoke in a certain way to me, I answered her everything
without waking. I got up in my sleep, put on my mother's
clothes, put on a cape and a nightcap, bade farewell to the children,
to whom I wanted to be the mother, charged them to be brave and
promised to bring them something. Then I took a piece of wood in
my hand for an umbrella and walked about the room as if holding
it opened out over my head because the sun shone. In reality it
was the shining of the lamp. Mother's clothes were long and yet
I wore the train beautifully and gracefully, without stepping on the
skirt. My mother doubled herself with laughter when she saw such
a caricature. Mostly I played the mother. Often I carried a small
piece of wood wrapped in a cloth as a child in my arm and laid it on
my breast. I sang songs, hushed at the same time other children&mdash;and
knew nothing at all of it next day. Mother laughed most over
this, that when I dressed myself, I first turned everything wrong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15">15</a></span>side out. This goes back to the fact that Mother sometimes, when
she had to get up in the night on my account and was half asleep,
slipped her robe on twisted and wrong side out. These things lasted
until my seventeenth year, when Mother was sick and I, as related
above, made coffee in the presence of the Sister of Mercy.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother was rather often ill, so that beside the care of her, in
which later a nurse assisted us, the shop had also to be looked after,
which always demanded one person during the day. If I lay down
upon my bed after two or three weeks of nursing, I fell into a deep
sleep. This never hindered me however from being in my place to
the minute, when my mother's medicine was to be taken. My mother
could have anything from me, although I lay in a deep sleep. She
did not need to speak, and if she wanted anything, she spoke it half
aloud. The Sister, over weary from night watching, slept lightly,
but if Mother needed anything, it was sufficient for her to breathe
my name and I was awake, although otherwise I did not hear well
and must always be aroused for some time before I was fully awake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In reality I merely imitated my mother in my sleep walking.
In the first place it was my wish to hold some object in my arms
during the night, or lay it near me, as if it were my child, to have
one that I might play with it sexually. In the second place this went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16">16</a></span>back to my early childhood when I lay near my mother and she
played thus with me. In the third place it referred to a later time
when I felt as a mother toward my doll, and never allowed it out of
my lap by day nor out of my arms at night. When Mother wished
to quiet me if I was suddenly afraid of ugly creatures at night, she
had to make a light as quickly as possible. Then she took me upon
her arm or laid me close to her. The light must however remain
burning until I had fallen asleep so that the horrible faces could not
torture me. As a child I often cried only for the light; it was the
light that first completely quieted me. I longed indeed for the
light that I might see the blood, and at the same time excite myself
upon my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The patient proceeds in her story: &ldquo;This continued until the
seventeenth year. At eighteen I had to go into the country because
of a nervous trouble. There I was quite alone and also had to sleep
alone in a room. I always went to sleep very late and once&mdash;my
small room was bright with moonlight&mdash;I arose, went into the small
passageway, which opened into the court, and was going out of the
courtyard gate. I was obliged to turn back, however, because this
was fastened. Yet instead of going back to my room, I went into
the sleeping room of my landlady, who was sleeping there with her
daughter, a girl of about twenty-six years. The moon was also
shining into this room and I slowly opened the door. Both of them
then awoke and were, as they told me next day, frightened to death.
It affected the daughter especially, so that she was terrified and at
once sought refuge in her mother's bed. I went back. What happened
further I cannot say, for the daughter had immediately bolted
the door behind me. I had made it impossible for me to stay longer
in the little country village, and although I had paid for my room
for a month I preferred to go away two days later. All the people
avoided me and looked at me askance. Most of all the people with
whom I was stopping! I saw that a stone rolled from their hearts
when I departed.&rdquo; At my question, whether she perhaps had been
especially attracted by her landlady, she answered: &ldquo;No, but in fact
with another woman of the village. And it seems that I at that time
wished to go to this woman in my sleep walking. At least the landlady's
room, into which I went, after I found the gate of the courtyard
fastened, lay in the direction of the house where she lived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From this time nothing is known of my walking in my sleep
even on moonlight nights. Only I have sometimes since that time
put on my underclothes in the night, but always my own. That is I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17">17</a></span>have often discovered in the morning, up till quite recently, that I
had on my linen or my stockings. Besides I often dressed my hair
during the night, and if I had had my hair, for example, braided or
loose when I went to sleep, I would awaken in the morning with my
hair put upon my head. This unconscious hair dressing happened
most frequently before menstruation and was then an absolute sign
that this would take place very soon. This has the following connection.
Mother never went to sleep with her hair done up, but
when in bed had it always hanging down in a braid. Only, when
she was suffering from the hemorrhages&mdash;at the time of menstruation
I also lost a good deal of blood&mdash;she did not have the braid
hanging down but put up upon her head. Before the appearance of
menstruation this braid hanging down annoyed me very much.
Furthermore, the doing of my hair in my sleep, which occurred a
few days before, is only the wish again to see blood, for which
reason it appears only usually before menstruation.&rdquo; I will add to
complete this that the ceasing of her sleep walking at her eighteenth
year was contemporaneous with her taking up regular sexual relations
with different men.</p>

<p>The patient gives still other important illustrations of her awaking
at the calling of her name by her mother, and of staring into the
light, particularly the moon. &ldquo;In school my thoughts were always
on the sexual and therefore I heard nothing when an example was
explained. I often resolved to listen attentively, but in a few minutes
I was again occupied with sexual phantasies. Then if I heard my
name called I woke up suddenly but had first to orient myself and
think where I was. This awaking at the calling of my name at
school was exactly like that when my mother called me by name
during my sleep walking. Both times I was startled and awoke as
if from a heavy dream. That excessive dreaming while awake goes
back however to my earliest childhood, when I sat evenings on my
mother's lap, while my parents were talking together, and excited
myself with her. Oh, what wonderful things I dreamed! I always
revelled then in sexual phantasies, and, completely lost in them, forgot
entirely where I was until I suddenly heard my name called,
when I started up frightened and had first to orient myself. Mother
always called my name softly and usually added, when I began to
yawn, &lsquo;the pillow is calling you,&rsquo; and imitating a wee voice, &lsquo;You
ought to come to it in bed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more: &ldquo;When evenings I began to dream on mother's lap,
I was compelled to look directly into the flame of the lamp. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18">18</a></span>looked straight into it and was as if hypnotized. I laid both hands
upon my mother's breasts and traced their form. Besides I had my
braid lying upon her left breast, which I liked very much, because it
lay as softly as upon a pillow. I was also compelled to look into the
light, gazed steadily at the flame until my eyes were closed. Then I
lay in a half sleep, in which I heard the voices of the family without
understanding what was said. Thus I could dream best, until my
mother called my name and I awoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every day I took delight in this sleep by the light of the lamp
and the pleasure experienced upon my mother's lap. I lay quietly
and with eyes closed so that they all thought I was fast asleep. Yet
I knew indeed that it was no ordinary sleep, but merely a &lsquo;daydream,&rsquo;
from which I only awoke when Mother called me by name.
When she did not do this, but quietly undressed me and put me into
bed, I began to be restless. I stood up in bed, lay down at their feet
and took care to cry out and throw myself about until Mother, quite
alarmed, called me by name and quieted me. I believe that in these
experiences lies another root for my staring at the moon when sleep
walking, as well as for the dreamy state occasioned by the fixed gazing
at the light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In conclusion there are still some less important psychic overdeterminations.
&ldquo;I often had the desire, when looking at the moon
at the age of four or five, to climb over the houses into the moon. I
knew nothing at that time of sleep walkers. About the same time
my sisters often sang the well-known song: &lsquo;What sort of a wry
face are you making, oh Moon?&rsquo; I stared immovably also at the
moon, when I had the opportunity to look at it once from my window,
in order that I might discover its face and eyes. Then, too,
my eyes grew weary and began to close. Later, when nine or ten
years old, I heard other children say that people dwelt in the moon.
I would have given anything to know how these people looked, and
whenever it was full moon, I gazed fixedly at it. I had understood
that another people dwelt there of a different race. I wished to
have another race of men. Perhaps they had other customs, thought
differently, ran about naked as in Paradise and there I wished to go,
and lead a free life with boys as with girls. Even as a child I
seemed to myself quite different from the rest of humankind on account
of my sexual concerns and sexual phantasies in school. I
always believed that I was something peculiar and for that reason
belonged not on the earth but upon the moon. Once when I heard
the word &lsquo;mooncalf&rsquo; and asked what it meant, some one at home
told me that mooncalves were deformed children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19">19</a></span>&ldquo;I thought however that they did not understand; the children
were quite differently formed, just as were all the people in the
moon, so that their feelings were altogether different and they led
a sexual life of a quite different kind. I thought they were kind to
both sexes, because Mother always said, &lsquo;You must not be alone
with boys!&rsquo; and that in the moon this was permitted, for there no
distinction was made between the sexes in play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked her more particularly in conclusion whether her explanation
for staring at the moon, that she identified moon and lamplight,
was all there was of it. She answered immediately that another
explanation had pressed itself upon her earlier, which she had
rejected as &ldquo;too foolish.&rdquo; &ldquo;The moon's shining disk reminded me
in fact of a woman's smooth body, the abdomen and most of all the
buttocks. It excited me very greatly if I saw a woman from behind.
Whenever I am fondling any one erotically and have my hand on
the buttocks&mdash;I always think then of a woman&mdash;the moon always
occurs to me but in the thought of a woman's body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to this explanation the sleep walker would have also
stared at the planet, because the round sphere awoke sexual childhood
memories of the woman's body, or, as I learned from another
source, of the woman's breast, most frequently however of her buttocks.
It is moreover noteworthy that it was always only the full
moon that worked thus attractively, not by chance the half moon or
the sickle. An everyday experience agrees very well with this.
Children, when they see the full moon or their attention is called to
it, begin to snigger. Every one familiar with the child psyche knows
that such giggling is based on sexual meaning, because the little
ones usually think of the nates. Not infrequently will children,
when they are placed on the chamber, pull away their nightclothes
with the words, &ldquo;Now the full moon is up,&rdquo; likewise when a child
accidentally or intentionally bares himself at that spot.</p>

<p>We have now the explanation, if we put together that which has
just been told us, why our sleep walker wakes up on the spot and
comes to herself as soon as she is called by name. This corresponds
to her starting awake when in school she was recalled from her
sexual daydreams and the earlier being startled when the mother
called her out of similar sexual phantasies to go to sleep. The inference
may be drawn from this however that one is startled from
sexual dreaming also when the name is called during sleep walking,
or going a step further, that sexual phantasies are at the bottom of
sleep walking in the moonlight and first find their fulfilment here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20">20</a></span>Could the interpretation of our patient be generalized, it might
be said that the sleep walker climbs upon the roofs as a fulfilment
of a childish wish to climb up into the very moon. It is of significance
also how far we may consider universal her infantile belief
that everything sexual is permitted upon the moon, that what
was strongly forbidden her upon earth was there allowed to other
children, and further the opinion that she was quite different because
of her sexual phantasying and did not after all belong upon the
earth but on the moon. At any rate the two motives introduced
for staring at the moon's disk may be frequently met, are perhaps
constantly present, that is the similarity of the moonlight and lamplight
and the comparison of the moon's disk to the human body,
especially the nates.</p>

<p>Let us attempt to realize now what this case before us may have
to teach, the first and so far the only one of its kind to be submitted
to a careful analysis. It must naturally be candidly confessed from
the start that from a single case history, be it ever so clearly and
fully set forth, no general conclusions may be drawn. Moreover
certain factors resist generalization because they are of a more
specialized character and at most will only occasionally reappear, as
for example, the strong sadistic note, the desire for blood, the hemoptysis
of the beloved mother. More frequently, also with the
female sex, there may be the wish to climb into bed with the parents
or their substitutes, to play the rôle of mother or father, out of love
for them, and finally in general homosexuality may be a driving
factor.</p>

<p>It is the sexual coloring and motivation of the sleep walking,
especially by the light of the moon, which gives throughout the
strongest tone to our case. This is something which the scientific
authors have so far as good as completely overlooked, even where
it has forced itself into view, as in a series of cases cited by Krafft-Ebing.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
We shall hear, in discussing the works of the poets, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21">21</a></span>they and the folk place this very motive before all others, indeed
often take it as the only one. We have here once more before us,
if this opinion be correct, a scientific erotophobia, that is the dread&mdash;mostly
among physicians and psychologists&mdash;of sexuality, although
this is at least one of the chief driving instincts of human
life.</p>

<p>There exists a better agreement of opinion over the relationship
between sleep walking and the dream. Sleep walking, analogously
to the latter, fulfills also wishes of the day, behind which
stand always wishes from childhood. Only it must also be emphasized
that the old, like the recent wishes, are exclusively or predominantly
of a sexual nature. Because however that sexual desire
is forbidden in the waking life, it must even as in the dream
take refuge in the sleeping state, where it can be gratified unconsciously
and therefore without guilt or punishment. Most of the
sleep activities of our patient were performed originally in a state
of apparent sleep, that is actually practiced in the conscious state
until later they were carried out quite unconsciously. She would
never then betray what when feigning sleep she had to conceal as
causes. Finally the directly precipitating causes in her erotic nature
for the sleep walking and moon walking seem especially to have
been light and the shining of the moon, her puberty and her mother's
sickness.</p>

<p>All of our patient's sleep walking, in accordance with the etiology
and interpretation, since it goes back to infantile sexuality, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22">22</a></span>half sexual, half outspokenly infantile. It reaches the greatest degree,
indeed the moon walking sets in just at the time of sexual
maturity and leads to the most complicated actions before the menses,
that is at the time of the greatest sexual excitement. And this
activity in sleep and the moon walking too almost cease when the
patient enters upon regular sexual intercourse. The shining of
every light stimulates her sexually, especially that of the moon.
The wandering about in her nightgown or in the scantiest clothing
is plainly erotically conditioned (exhibition), but also the going
about in the ghostly hours (see later), finally the being wakened
through the softest calling of her name by the mother, with whom
alone she stands in a contact like that of hypnotic somnambulism.</p>

<p>Purely childish moreover is the clever technique of disguise. First
she simulates illness or fear in order to be taken into the mother's
bed. Then she pretends to be asleep, talks in her sleep, throws herself
about in her sleep, that she may be able to do everything without
punishment and without being blamed, finally plays the mother
in a manner which corresponds completely to child's play. Also
later, before and after wandering in the bright moonlight, she produces
specially deep sleep and first as if in an obsession tries the
door repeatedly to see if it is closed. I see in this, naturally apart
from possible organic causes of profound sleep, an unconscious purpose,
which plainly insists: &ldquo;Just see, how sound-asleep I am (we
are reminded of the earlier pretending to be asleep) and how
afraid I am that the door might be left open! Whoever has to walk
about in spite of such sound sleep and such precaution, and even
perhaps do certain things which might be sexually interpreted, he
plainly is not to blame for it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We might add from knowledge of the neuroses that the fear that
some one might be hiding in the room signifies the wish that this
might be so in order that the subject might be sexually gratified.
There was one circumstance most convincing in regard to this, which
I will now add. Even during the time of her psychoanalytic treatment,
when she did not wander at night any more nor perform complicated
acts in her sleep, she had a number of times in the country
carefully locked the door of her room in the evening, only to find it
open again in the morning. To be sure, her lover of that period
slept under the same roof, though at some distance from her.</p>

<p>Before I go more closely into the question as to what share the
light had upon the sleep walking of our patient, I will recall once
more that her actions during sleep were at first but few and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23">23</a></span>nothing to do with the light. As the years went by they became
more complicated and finally took place only under the influence of
the light, whether it was artificial or natural, that is of the moon.
More extended walks were in general possible only in the light of the
moon, which as a heavenly body shining everywhere threw its brightness
over every thing, in the court, garden and over the street, while
candles or lamps at the best lighted one or two rooms. The patient,
given to sleep walking or moon walking, went after the light, which
meanwhile represented to her from childhood on a symbol of the
parents' love and gave hope of sexual enjoyment.</p>

<p>It was also bound inseparably within with motor activities of an
erotic nature. When her mother approached her bed with the light
it was a reminder to the child, Now you must go upon the chamber
and you can pass &ldquo;the good,&rdquo; or, when she sat on the mother's
lap and gazed into the lamplight, Now you may stimulate yourself
according to your heart's desire. Then the lamp was shining when
the little one wished to climb into bed with the mother in order that,
while exhibiting herself, she might see her as scantily covered as possible.
And finally the striking of the light announced, &ldquo;the mother
is sick, in nursing her you will have the opportunity to see her bared
breasts and her blood.&rdquo; Evidently the light thus led, when she
climbed after it, to the greatest experience of sexual pleasure of her
earliest childhood. On account of this strong libido possession the
memory of the light was kept alive in the unconscious and it needed
only that the light of the lamp or the candle should fall upon the
face of the wanderer to permit her to experience in the most profound
sleep the same pleasure, the unconscious was set into activity
and everything was accomplished most manifestly according to the
purpose that served her strong libido.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that our patient distinguished immediately a
strong feeling of pleasure by the shining of every light, that moreover
she seemed to herself as a supernatural being (glorification
through the sexual feeling of pleasure<a name="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>), that she herself imagined
it must represent a second sort of consciousness, and finally that she
stood in such contact with the beloved person as that of a hypnotized
subject&mdash;somnambulist&mdash;with her hypnotist. For she perceived
also the mother's lightest word when most soundly asleep, in spite of
her difficulty in hearing at other times.</p>

<p>What was the patient's intention in her longer walks under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24">24</a></span>moon's influence, that she, for instance, climbed to the first story,
reflected for a moment and then started to go out at the gate? That
becomes comprehensible when it is remembered that she once opened
the door in her sleep for her lover in the country and furthermore
in her first complicated sleep walking. The purpose of the latter has
been stated, to climb into her mother's bed in order to obtain the
greatest sexual pleasure. I do not believe I am far astray when I
assume that this erotic desire of the child lies also essentially at the
basis of her more extensive wandering in the moonlight. She
simply wishes each time to go to the bed of some beloved one, which,
as we shall hear later, is accepted by poets and the folk mind as a
chief motive, and a fundamental one for many instances of sleep
walking, especially with maidens.</p>

<p>It becomes clear now, likewise, why the patient climbs into the
first story, then recollects herself and seeks to go out at the gate.
In her seventh year she and her family had changed their abode
and this had been before in the first story but was now on an
upper floor. She is trying yet to climb into the mother's bed, this
still remaining as a fundamental motive. Only she is not seeking
the bed where it stands at the present time but where it stood in
childhood, in the first story and in another house. She goes, therefore,
downstairs but remembers, unconsciously of course, that this is
not the right floor and wants now to go out at the gate to find the
home of her childhood. Later in the country when she so thoroughly
frightens her landlady and her daughter, there she is also
going to a woman she loves and she leaves the house for this purpose
and goes at least into the room that lies in the direction of the
house where the beloved lies. Later still she opens the door wide in
her sleep so that her lover can have free entrance.</p>

<p>We might also explain now in great part the sleep walking of the
mother. As far as I can discover, the mother also as a very small
child lived in another home than the one in which her sleep walking
began. She ran about her room at night and could not find her
bed and felt around in distress without coming upon the chamber,
both of which stood in the usual places. This may be explained by
the fact that in phantasy she was seeking the bed and chamber of
her earliest childhood, which of course stood elsewhere. Moreover
she attained by her moaning the fulfilment of her unconscious wish
to be set by her mother upon the chamber and then lifted into bed.
The wanderings in the moonlight, after which likewise she could not
find her way back to bed, may be similarly explained, though I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25">25</a></span>learned only this much about her dancing in the moonlight, that in
her childhood she was very fond of dancing, which is also the
case with our patient. Perhaps she wished also to play elves in the
moonlight, according to poems or fairy tales or had, like her daughter,
earned the special love of her parents through her skill in
dancing.</p>

<p>We are now at the chief problem. How is it then that the night's
rest, the guarding of which is always the goal of the dream, is
motorially broken through in sleep walking? There is first a special
organic disposition, which is absent from no sleep walker, a heightened
motor stimulability<a name="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. This appears clearly with children, and
so for example with our patient as a tendency to convulsive attacks,
pavor nocturnus and terrifying dreams, from which she starts up.</p>

<p>As far as my observations go, it seems to me that there is a
special disposition to sleep walking in the descendants of alcoholics
and epileptics, of individuals with a distinctively sadistic character,
finally of hysterics, whose motor activity is strongly affected, who
also suffer with convulsions, tremor, paralyses or contractures. It
should be merely briefly mentioned that the heightened motor excitability
also establishes a disposition to a special muscle erotic,
which in fact was easily demonstrable in every one of the cases of
sleep walking and moon walking which have become known to me.
The disturbance of the night's rest was made desirable through the
satisfaction of the muscle erotic to every one for whom the excessive
muscular activity offered an entirely specialized pleasure,
even sexual enjoyment.</p>

<p>Moreover in our case a series of features besides those already
mentioned bear undoubted testimony to the abnormally increased
muscle erotic. I have already elsewhere discussed them in detail<a name="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
and will here merely name briefly the chief factors. The patient had
an epileptic alcoholic grandfather on the mother's side, who was
notorious when under the influence of alcohol for his cruelty and
pleasure in whipping. She had, besides a strongly sadistic mother,
two older brothers, of whom the elder was frightfully violent and
brutal, often choking his brothers and sisters, while the other found
an actually diabolical pleasure in destroying and demolishing everything.
Our patient exhibited already at two years old as well as
through her whole life a pleasure in striking blows, and also conversely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26">26</a></span>a special pleasure in receiving them, further at four years
old an intensive delight in dancing, an enjoyment that was unmistakably
sexual. We have learned above how she delighted to press
herself upon her mother's body or twine herself about her legs.
Moreover, finally, one of her very earliest hysterical symptoms was
a paralysis of the arm.</p>

<p>More difficult seems to me the answer to the second main question:
What influence does the moon exercise upon the sleeper? It
was earlier discussed, along with the various psychical overdeterminations,
that the moonlight awoke first the infantile pleasure
memories, among other things that that light shining everywhere
lighted the way which led to the house and the dwelling of the
earliest childhood. Mention was made of the infantile comparison
of the moon's disk with the childish nates and perhaps the gazing
upon the nightly orb, which seems besides most like a hypnotic
fixation, may be also referred back to the same. Since we know
today that the love transference constitutes the essential character
of hypnotism, that symptom brings us once more to the eroticism.
Beside there was not wanting with our patient a grossly sensual
relationship. Finally there is also the infantile desire to climb over
the houses into the moon, realizing itself in part at least in the moon-inspired
climbing upon the roof.</p>

<p>Yet the second leading problem appears to me, in spite of all
this, not completely exhausted. It might not thus be absolutely
ruled out that more than a mere superstition lurks behind the folk
belief which conceives of a &ldquo;magnetic&rdquo; influence by which the moon
attracts the sleeper. Such a relationship is indeed conceivable when
we consider the motor overexcitability of all sleep walkers and the
effecting of ebb and flow through the influence of the moon. Furthermore
no one, in an epoch which brings fresh knowledge each
year of known and unknown rays, can deny without question any
influence to the rays of moonlight. Perhaps in time the physicist
and the astronomer will clear up the matter for us. Meanwhile the
question is raised and can be answered only with an hypothesis.</p>

<p>In conclusion I have in mind a last final connection which the
spell of the moon bears to belief in spirits and ghosts. It is established
through many analyses that the visits of the mother by night
form the basis of the latter, when she comes with the light in her
hand and scantily clothed in white garments, nightgown, or chemise
and petticoat, to see if the children are asleep or, if they are, to set
a child upon the chamber. The so often mentioned &ldquo;woman in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27">27</a></span>white&rdquo; may also be the maiden in her nightgown, who thus exhibits
<ins title="hereself">herself</ins> in her night garment to her parents as she climbs into their
bed, later also eventually to her lover. The choice of the hour between
twelve and one, which came to be called the ghostly hour, may
perhaps be referred to the fact that at this time sleep was most profound
and therefore there was least danger of discovery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 2.</span> I introduce here a second case, in which to be sure the
influence of the moon represented only an episode and therefore received
also but a brief analysis. It is that of a twenty-eight year old
forester, who came under psychoanalytic treatment on account of
severe hysterical cardiac distress. The cause of this was a damming
up of his feelings toward his mother, for whom he longed in the
unconscious. His condition of anxiety broke out when he went to
live with his mother after the death of his father and slept in the
next room. He admitted that his father drank. Every Sunday he
was somewhat drunk. Likewise the mother, who kept a public
house, was in no way disinclined toward alcohol. He himself had
consumed more beer especially in his high school days than was
good for him. I would emphasize in his sexual life, as belonging to
our theme, his strong urethral erotic, which made him a bed wetter
in childhood, led in later years to frequent micturition at night and
caused a serious dysuria psychica. His muscle erotic finally drove
him to the calling of a forester.</p>

<p>Only the portions of his psychoanalysis, which lasted for eight
weeks, which have to do with his sleep activities and his response
to the moon will be brought forward. Thus he relates at one time:
&ldquo;At thirteen years old, when I was in a lodging house kept by a
woman, I arose one morning with the dark suspicion that I had done
something in the night. What I did not remember. I merely felt
stupefied. Suddenly the boys who slept with me began to laugh,
for from under my bed ran a stream of urine. In the night the full
moon had shone upon my bed. We fellows had no vessel there but
had to go outside, which with my frequent need for urination during
the night was very unpleasant. Now there stood under my bed a
square box for hats and neckties, which I, as I got up in the night
half intoxicated with sleep, had taken for a chamber and I had
urinated in it. This was repeated. Another time, also at full moon,
I wet a colleague's shoe. They all said that I must be a little loony.
When the full moon came, I was always afraid that I might do this
again, an anxiety which remained long with me. I never dared
sleep, for example, so that the full moon could shine directly upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28">28</a></span>me. Yes; still something else. Two or three years later the following
happened, only I do not know whether there was moonlight.
I was sleeping with several colleagues in a room adjoining that of
the lodging house keepers, the man and his wife. I must have gone
into them at night and done something sexual. Either I wished to
climb into bed with the wife or I had masturbated, I do not know
which. I had at any rate the next day the suspicion that something
of the kind had happened. The landlord and landlady laughed so
oddly, but they said nothing to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your mother perhaps in your childhood come to look after
you with the light?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; that is so. My mother always stayed
up for a long time and came in regularly late at night with the light
to go to bed. My father was obliged to go early to bed because of
his work and had to get up at midnight, when he always made a
light.&rdquo; Here he suddenly broke off: &ldquo;Perhaps it is for this reason
that I have an anxiety in an entirely dark room. If there is not at
least a bit of light I can not perform coitus.&rdquo;&mdash;<ins title="How">&ldquo;How</ins> is that?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
have remonstrated rather seriously with myself that the sexual act
could be performed only with a light.&rdquo;&mdash;Then at a later hour of
analysis: &ldquo;When my father went away at night, I came repeatedly
into my mother's bed. I lay down in my father's bed, also in a
certain measure put myself into his place.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Did your mother call
you, or did you come of yourself?&rdquo;&mdash;<ins title="I">&ldquo;I</ins> believe that my mother invited
me to her. Now something occurs to me: The moonlight
awoke me as my father woke me when he struck a light as he was
going out. Then it was time to go into bed with my mother, for
the father was gone, which always gave me a feeling of reassurance.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
when he was gone he could do nothing more to the
mother. And <ins title="they">then</ins> you could take his place with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two months later came the following to supplement this: &ldquo;Already
in the grammar school I was always afraid someone might
attack me in the night, because of which I always double locked the
room and looked under the bed and in every chest. In childhood
Mother came in fact to look after me and set me on the chamber.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Then
your neurotic anxiety presumably signifies the opposite, the
wish that your mother shall come to you <ins title="again&rdquo;">again.&rdquo;</ins>&mdash;&ldquo;Or rather, I bolt
the door so that my father cannot come to my mother. I followed in
this also a command of my mother, &lsquo;Lock yourself in well!&rsquo; She
always had a fear of burglars. Now even since I have been living
with my mother she has said to me more than once, that I should
lock myself in well. But I thought to myself, &lsquo;What, bolt myself
<ins title="in!&rsquo;">in!&rsquo;&rdquo;</ins>&mdash;&ldquo;That would mean also that if the mother wants to come, only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29">29</a></span>she should come.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That is just what I thought to myself, when
Mother woke me early, that she need not knock but come right in.
In the daytime I lay in my mother's bed because her room was
warmer than mine. I was feeling very wretchedly at that time
and my mother said in the evening, &lsquo;Stay there where you are; I
will sleep in the little room next. Leave the door open.&rsquo; In the
night I know I was very restless.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Did you not perhaps have the
wish that your mother should look at her sick child in the night, as
she once did when you were younger?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, to be sure. This
wish pursued me and therefore I slept badly. I would have carried
the thing out further if my dysuria had not hindered me. If I had
arisen in the night or the morning, then Mother would at once have
heard me in her light sleep and I would not have been able to urinate.
One time I crept out of bed very quietly so that she did not hear
me, and yet it held back a long time until I couldn't stand it any
longer. It was just the same at the time when I was in the grammar
and the high school, if Mother asked me to sleep near her
and Father was not there. Then also I could urinate only with
great difficulty. And now when I was living with my mother, I
had the most severe excited attacks. There was no other reason
for I was neither a loafer nor a drunkard. I have laid myself down
in my mother's bed and been unwilling to get out. That is very
significant. And if at any time I went away from home I at once
felt so miserable that I must go back. I was immediately better
when once there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This case, when we consider it, is plain in its relationships. The
excessive love for the mother is a decisive factor as well as the desire
to play the rôle of the father with her. Therefore the fear of
burglars at night, behind which hides in part the anxiety that the
father would have sexual relations with the mother and in part the
wish that the latter might herself come to him. Joined to this is the
desire for all sorts of infantile experiences, such as the mother's
placing him every night upon the chamber because of his bed wetting.
In the later repression the pleasure in the enuresis as well as
in the being taken up by the mother becomes a dysuria psychica.
Naturally to the urethral eroticist in childhood, and also later unconsciously,
micturition is analogous to the sexual act. In puberty
the moonlight awakens him as in childhood the mother's light or
that of the father. So on the one hand the memory of the former
is awakened, who with the light in her hand reminded him to go to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30">30</a></span>the chamber,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and on the other hand the memory of the going out
of the father, which was a signal to him to go to his mother. He
arises and carries out with her symbolically the sexual act, for he
urinates into a vaginal symbol (box or shoe-vagina). Also the fact
that he got up once by the light of the full moon and wanted to
climb into the bed of the landlady, likewise a mother substitute, is
all of a piece. This case here before us, as may be seen, confirms
what the first has already taught us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cases</span> 3, 4, and 5.&mdash;I wish to give further a brief report of three
cases of walking by moonlight, which I regret to say I could only
briefly outline in passing, not being able to submit them to an exhaustive
analysis. In everything they confirm every detail of our
previous conclusions.</p>

<p>The first case is that of an unmarried woman of twenty-eight,
who walked in her sleep first in her sixth year and the second time
when she was nine years old. &ldquo;I got up when the full moon was
shining, climbed over a chair upon the piano and intended to go to
the window to unfasten it. Just then my father awoke and struck
me hard on my buttocks, upon which I went back and again fell
asleep. I often arose, went to each bed, that of the parents and
those of the brothers and sisters, looked at them and went back
again. Between sixteen and seventeen years old, when my periods
first occurred, the sleep walking stopped.&rdquo; She adds later: &ldquo;I frequently
as a child spoke out in my sleep. My nose began to bleed
when I was walking on the street and the sun shone upon me. After
this the sleep walking improved. I always clung affectionately to
my parents and brothers and sisters, and never received a blow except
in that one instance by my father.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Which you took rather
as a caress, than as a blow for punishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this case also the sleep walker plays sometimes the rôle of
the mother, who satisfies herself that her dear ones are asleep.
Moreover a period of talking in the sleep precedes the wandering
by moonlight. It is noteworthy that the sleep walking is intercepted
by a caressing blow from the father and ceases altogether when
menstruation sets in. Also earlier nosebleed had a beneficial effect.</p>

<p>The second case is that of a forty-year-old hysteric, who in her
marriage remained completely anesthetic sexually, although her husband
was thoroughly sympathetic to her and very potent. Her
father's favorite child, she strove in vain in early childhood for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31">31</a></span>affection of the mother, who on her part also suffered severely
from hysteria, with screaming fits, incessant tremor of the head and
hands and a host of nervous afflictions. This mother's daughters
had all of them always an extraordinary passion for muscular activity
with apparently great satisfaction in it. They were among
other things distinguished swimmers and enthusiastic dancers. My
patient besides could never tire of walking for hours at a time.</p>

<p>In our discussion she related the following to me concerning her
sleep walking: &ldquo;I got up once in the night when I was about ten
years old. I had dreamed that I was playing the piano. I found
myself however not in bed but standing between a chest and a desk
scratching upon the latter with my nails, as if playing the piano,
which finally awoke me. There was also a paper basket there which
either I had stepped over or there was a space through which I could
slip, at any rate the way there was not quite free. I stood in this
narrow space and dreamed I was playing the piano. Suddenly I
heard my mother's voice, &lsquo;Mizzi, where are you?&rsquo; She called me
several times before I finally awoke. Without it was not yet growing
daylight, but the moon shone brightly within. I recollected myself
immediately, realizing where I was, and went <ins title="beck">back</ins> to bed. I
told my mother, as an excuse, that I had to go to the chamber.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Had you at that time a great desire to play the piano?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Three
years later it made me sick that I had not had to learn, but then I
had as yet no desire for music. We had no piano at that time. Yet
among my earliest memories is that of the way in which my mother
played the piano. As a woman I wished that I could express my
joy and sorrow in music. I would mention further that my brother
and my uncle on the mother's side<a name="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> are both sleep walkers. The
former always wants to come into my bed in the night when he
walks in his sleep. I must emphasize that he is especially fond
of me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The following often happened to me after I was married but
never in my maidenhood. I awoke in the night, sat up in bed and
did not know what was the matter with me. I could not think consciously,
I was quite incapable of thought. I knew neither where I
was nor what was happening to me; I could remember nothing. I
did not know whether I was Jew or Christian, man or woman, a
human being or a beast, only stared straight ahead into the next
room, at a point of light. That was the only thing that appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32">32</a></span>clear to me. I held myself to it to regain clearness. I always said
to myself: &lsquo;What, what then? Where, how and why?&rsquo; My
powers of thought went no further. I was like a newborn child. I
stared fixedly at this point of light because I unconsciously thought
I would obtain clearness there for everywhere else it was dark.
This lasted for a long time until through the light I could distinguish
what it was that caused the light. It was from a street lamp, so
apparently before midnight, and the lamp lighted a bit of the wall
in the next room. After I had said to myself for a long time &lsquo;What,
what?&rsquo; and stared straight at that light, I learned gradually to distinguish
what made the light, that is to recognize, That there
above, is a bit of lamplight; again after some time; That is my
lamp. Upon this I recollected my home and then for the first time
everything else. When I had made out the outlines of things around
me, then returned the consciousness that I was a human being and
was married. Of all that I had not before been aware. I do not
remember that I had dreamed anything before this came on, or
that anything had excited me, nor that anything special had happened
beforehand. Beside nothing like it has ever happened to me
when I have been greatly excited. At the most, after my marriage
I led a life of strain. I was tied to a shop which was damp, unwholesome
and full of bad air, and I am a friend of fresh air. I
suffered very much mentally under these conditions, because I love
light and air.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Did you think that you were indeed not a human
being?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No; only that with God's help I would endure this life.&rdquo;
I will add here that her second sister also manifested similar disturbances
of consciousness.</p>

<p>We find first in the foreground a family disposition to sleep
walking and moon influence. The brother significantly always wants
in his wanderings to get into the sister's bed, while our patient herself
openly plays the part of mother, especially the mother of the
earliest childhood. It is interesting also that when in her married
life she had to give up her pleasure in light and air, the disturbances
of consciousness set in, from which she could free herself only
through fixing her attention upon a point of light. She had the distinct
feeling that from this point of light things would become clear
to her. One can easily think of occasions of being dazed by sleep
when perhaps the mother came with the candle in her hand to see
whether her child was asleep and the child awoke. The whole remarkable
occurrence would then be simply a desire for the mother's
love, which she all her life long so sorely missed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33">33</a></span>Now for the last case, a twenty-three year old married woman
suffering from a severe hysteria, who clung with great tenderness to
her parents, but received a reciprocal love only from her father,
while the mother preferred her sister. The patient told me of her
moon walking: &ldquo;I always wanted to sleep by the open blinds so that
the moon could shine upon me. My oldest brother walked about in
the night, drank water, went to the window and looked out, all of
course in his sleep, then he went back to bed and slept on. At the
same time he spoke very loudly, but quite unintelligible things and
one could actually observe that the moon exercised an attraction
over him. My younger healthy brother said that it was frightful, the
many things that he uttered in the night. I also climbed out of bed
one night when sixteen or seventeen years old, because I could not
find the moon, and sought it and met my moon haunted brother. I
immediately disappeared again going back to my bed and he did
not see me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was ill once, about the same time, with influenza, and continually
repeated in my feverish phantasies that they should take
down some one who was hanged and not punish him; he could not
help it. There was moonlight at that time and moreover a light
burned in the room. I took this for the moon, which I could not see
but wanted to see. I strove only all the time to see the moon. The
windows must be closed because I was afraid, but the blinds must
remain open so that I could see the moon. Some one roused me
then from my phantasies and there I saw that my cousin sat near
me. He was not however the one hanged, it was some one who was
first dragged out by another man, a warden in the prison. The face
of the one who was hanging I did not see, only his body.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Of
whom did he remind you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I do not know definitely and yet
it was the cousin who sat near me. And as I awoke, apparently I
called his name for he answered me, &lsquo;Yes, here I <ins title="am!&rsquo;">am!&rsquo;&rdquo;</ins>&mdash;&ldquo;What
about the warden of the prison?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A man is first locked up before
he is hanged.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Do you see also in phantasy something that hangs
down?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; when with my cousin I always had the desire to
see his membrum stiff, as it could be felt and noticed outlined
through his clothing.&rdquo; I will add likewise that behind the cousin
and her sexual wishes toward him analogous phantasies toward the
father were hidden. That which hangs down (pendens, penis) is
also the phallus. Her adjuration that the hanged person should not
be punished, he could not help it, is a demand for mercy for sexual
sins (see also later).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34">34</a></span>&ldquo;Upon the wedding journey my husband did not want to sleep
by the open blinds, and I wanted to sleep nowhere else so that the
moon could shine upon me. I could never sleep otherwise, was very
restless and it was always as if I wanted to creep into the moon. I
wanted, so to speak, to creep into the moon out of sight.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Recently
I was out in the country with my sister and slept by the open
blinds. The light from the heavens, to be sure not the moonlight,
forced its way in and I had the feeling as if something pierced me,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
in fact it pierced me somehow in the small of my back, and I arose
with my eyes closed and changed the position of the bed, upon which
I slept well. I knew nothing of it that I had arisen, but something
must have happened because I now could lie comfortably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something else still. About two years ago I observed the moon
in the country, as it was reflected in the water, and I could not tear
myself from this spectacle until I was suddenly awakened by my
husband and cried out. Five or six years ago I went out in a boat
upon the Wolfgang lake. The moon was reflected in the water and
I sat there very still. Suddenly my brother, the one who is well, with
whom I do not have much to do, asked, &lsquo;What are you thinking
of?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Nothing at all.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It must be something.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No, nothing!&rsquo;
As we climbed out, I was still quite absent minded. Also at night I
always had the moon before me and spoke with it.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Consciously
or in a dream?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I believe I was more asleep than awake. For if
any one had come upon me then I should have felt it very painfully.
I have incidentally noted the words: &lsquo;Oh moon with thy white
face, thou knowest I am in love only with thee. Come down to me.
I languish in torture, let me only comfort myself upon thy face.
Thou enticing, beautiful, lovely spirit, thou torturest me to death,
my suffering rends me, thou beautiful Moon, thou sweet one, mine,
I implore thee, release me from this pain, I can bear it no longer.
Ah, what avail my words and my complainings! Be thou my happiness,
take me with thee, <em>only pleasure of the senses do I desire
for myself</em>. Thou Moon, most beautiful and best, <em>save me, take my
maidenhood, I am not evil to thee</em>. Draw me mightily to thyself,
do not leave off, thy kisses have been so good to me.&rsquo;&rdquo; As may be
seen, she loved the moon like a lover to whom she would yield herself
entirely. The grossly sexual relationship is evident. It is after
this fragment doubly regrettable that a penetrating psychoanalysis
was not here possible.</p>

<p>The early sexual content of the moon desire and its connection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35">35</a></span>with the parent complex is shown by her further statement: &ldquo;Last
summer in the country I had only my mother-in-law with whom I
could talk. It was the time of the new moon and I could not bear
complete darkness in my room. It was frightfully lonely to me thus
and I could not sleep. I had the idea that in the lonely darkness
someone was coming to me and I was afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It soon came to light that she and her sister in their early childhood
and again between the ages of eight and thirteen shared the
parents' sleeping room and had repeatedly spied upon their sexual
intercourse. Her present fear is also evidently the wish to put herself
in the place of the mother, to whom the father comes. She recalls
yet one more episode: <ins title="&lsquo;When">&ldquo;When</ins> I was nine or ten years old, the
healthy brother was ill with typhoid and the parents were up nights
on his account. We sisters were sent to stay elsewhere, where we
had opportunity to play with a boy who carried on a number of
sexual things with us. I then dreamed of him at night and phantasied
the sexual things which I had done with him in the daytime.
Apparently I had also at that time played underneath with my genitals.
At the same time, while my brother had typhoid, I was unwilling
to go to sleep and could not, because I could have no rest while
my brother was ill.&rdquo; It is clear without further discussion to one
who understands these things that it was not anxiety for the brother
but secret, yet insistent sexual wishes which caused the sleeplessness.
It is finally significant that, when later she dreamed of a
burglar, he always came after her with a knife, or choked her, as
her cousin and mother had often done to her.</p>

<p>As we consider this third case of moon affectivity we find
again familiar phenomena, connections with early sexual dreams
and the parent complex. Especially noteworthy is further her
direct falling in love with the moon, to which she addresses her
adoration in verses and to which she even offers her virginity. It
is as if she saw in it a man, who should free her from her sexual
need. One is reminded how in the first case, the one cured by psychoanalysis,
the four-year-old girl sought continually the moon's
face on the ground of a students' song. It could not, we regret to
say, be ascertained, in the absence of a psychoanalysis, whether in
this case the heavenly body represented to the moon walker some
definite person or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 6.</span>&mdash;I add here three autobiographical reports, which I
have gathered from literature. The first originates with the
famous anatomist and physiologist Karl Friedrich Burdach, who
from his tenth to his thirtieth year had occasional attacks of moon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36">36</a></span>walking, although he apparently &ldquo;enjoyed the most perfect health.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have during these periods,&rdquo; he himself relates, &ldquo;undertaken
actions which I had to recognize as mine, merely because they could
have been carried out by no one else. Thus one day it was incomprehensible
to me why I had on no shirt when I awoke, and it remained
so in spite of my utmost efforts to recollect myself, until the
shirt was found in another room rolled together under a press. In
my twenty-ninth year I was awakened from a night wandering by
the question, What did I want? and then the consciousness of the
somnambulistic state passed over in part to the awaking. First I
found the question strange, but since I thought the reason for it
would become plain, I need not betray it. Immediately, however,
as I began to waken, I asked myself in what that consisted and,
now that the somnambulistic state was over, the answer must be
due me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One cannot help finding this self revelation exceedingly interesting.
The hiding of the shirt, although the affair is so incompletely
reported, especially in its motivation, points unmistakably at least to
exhibitionism. The second sleep walking appears much more difficult
of explanation. In this Burdach sought plainly a definite
goal, which seemed so clear and transparent to him that he could
not at all understand why anyone should question him about it. If
we consider that his first thought on waking was that he need not
betray this purpose, that moreover there enters at once a repression
and causes him completely to forget it, there remains then no other
possibility than that we have to do with a strongly forbidden wish,
which the conscious censor will not allow to pass. It is easy to conceive
a sexual motivation in this second instance if we remember
that in the first sleep walking something sexual surely took place.</p>

<p>Still more probable is the strongly forbidden sexual goal, if we
take into consideration the circumstances of his life. In his autobiography
&ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rückblick auf mein Leben</span>&rdquo; Burdach tells us how extraordinarily
his mother depended upon him. &ldquo;Having already
lost four children in their first year, she had longed to bear another
child and especially since the setting in of the illness of my father
had compelled her to think of losing him, she had wished for a son
as a sure object for her love-thirsty heart. Her wish was fulfilled
when she bore me.&rdquo; Eleven months later the father died, leaving
his wife and his little son not yet a year old unprovided for. Nevertheless
she, the widow, rejected the proposal to return to her parents'
home and preferred rather &ldquo;trouble, need and a thousand cares
up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37">37</a></span>on herself in order that I might be better educated; for I was the
object of her deepest love. About nine o'clock in the evening she
went with me to bed and twined her arm about me; in the morning
she stole from my side and permitted me an hour or two more of
rest (p.&nbsp;14).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women had a particular influence upon me; but it was also
natural to me to attach myself to them. As my mother related, I
never as a child went for a ride on my hobby horse without having
at parting and on my return kissed my hand to my lady represented
by a doll&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;24). It is superfluous to add that this lady was no
other than his mother. Also the following passage I think is significant:
&ldquo;I was by nature endowed with as great a sensitiveness to
womanly charm as to womanly dignity and this inclination toward
the other sex grounded in my psychical constitution was nurtured by
circumstances from my earliest youth on. I could but recognize very
soon the high intellectual and moral quality of my good mother, who
in her struggle with poverty kept herself fresh and free from vulgarity
and shunned no sacrifice for me. Likewise the matrons to
whose well wishing I owe my gratitude, inspired me with high
respect for their character. In my former nurse there seemed to
me a pattern of tireless and sagacious activity of a high order and
breeding.&hellip; Thus a high respect for true womanhood was implanted
in me. On the other hand I was as a boy made so accustomed
to this rôle by several young women, who entertained themselves
with me and considered me as their lover to while away their
time, that I later retained the inclination to play this part and considered
a friendly advance as an invitation which I in turn held as
a sacred claim of honor and an agreeable duty&rdquo; (pp.&nbsp;69&nbsp;ff.).</p>

<p>When later the mother took a young widow into lodgings, the
young man, then twenty-one years old, had &ldquo;the exalted feeling of
being her protector. Then it was all up with my heart&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;71).
The death of the dearest one to him on earth, his mother, followed
close upon this and brought an end to it. &ldquo;I became convinced
that happiness would be found for me only where I shared it with
another being, and that I could be satisfied only by a relationship
similar to that in which I had stood toward my mother; an inner bond
where only a single mutual interest controlled, where one soul found
its happiness only in the other. Without such an absolute love,
penetrating the whole being, life seemed to me worthless and stale.
My mother, whose unbounded love I had enjoyed, was torn from
me; my excellent uncle, heartily devoted to me, I saw in the enjoyment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38">38</a></span>of his own family happiness. And an unconquerable desire
for the same happiness tortured me as I felt my utter loneliness&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;79).
So he concluded to marry although he had only limited prospects
for supporting a family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first intimation that my wife was pregnant filled me with
delight. I took it for granted that Heaven would send me a daughter.
With my idea of the value of woman all my wishes tended
thither, to possess a daughter and to be able to watch over her while
she unfolded to a noble womanhood. She should have my mother
for her pattern and therefore also be named Caroline after her.<a name="FNanchor_16A_17" href="#Footnote_16A_17" class="fnanchor">[16a]</a> I
spoke so confidently, after I had left Vienna, of &lsquo;our daughter
Caroline&rsquo; in my letters to my wife that she was finally quite concerned
and sought to prepare me for the birth of a son. I had not
however made a mistake and my confidence was in the end justified&rdquo;
(pp.&nbsp;83&nbsp;ff.). His wife was confined at some distance from
him and then as soon as possible journeyed to him with the little
one. He relates as follows: &ldquo;I went in Borsdorf with a beating
heart to the carriage which brought her to me, kissed her hastily, took
my child out of her arms and carried it hastily into the inn, laid it
upon the table, loosed the bindings which bound it to its tiny bed and
was lost in happy contemplation of the beautifully formed, lovely,
vigorous and lively little girl and then first threw myself into the
arms of my wife, who in her mother's pride and joy was feasting
her eyes upon us, and then I had again to observe the lovely child.
What cared I for mankind! What cared I for the whole world! I
was more than happy&rdquo; (pp.&nbsp;85&nbsp;ff.).</p>

<p>The manner also in which he brought up his child is highly significant:
&ldquo;Our hearts clung mostly to our daughter.&hellip; I enjoyed
the pleasure of possessing her with full consciousness of her
worth, gazed upon her with rapture and was delighted when I observed
in her a new trait of beautiful womanly character. She
recognized by my serious treatment of her the entire depth of my
love, repaid it with inner devotion and challenged it with merry
playfulness. From her first year I delighted to lift her from her
bed in the morning and even when she was eight years old she often
got up of herself, knocked on the window of the alcove door leading
into my work room and whisked back to her bed, so that when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39">39</a></span>came she could throw herself with hearty laughter into my arms and
let me take her up. Or she slipped behind my chair and climbed up
behind my back, while I was deep in my work, so that she could fall
triumphantly upon my neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must refrain from mentioning more of her winsome childhood.
She was the most beautiful ornament of my life and in the
possession of her I felt myself, in spite of all pecuniary need, immeasurably
happy.&rdquo; It will not surprise any one with knowledge
of these things that a child so insatiable for love should become
hysterical. &ldquo;Her sensitiveness was unnaturally exaggerated,&rdquo; also
she was seized once with a hysterical convulsion, as Burdach relates.
She died young and &ldquo;the flower of my life was past. The fairest,
purest joy was extinguished for me. I had wished her for myself
and Heaven had heard me. Finding in her the fulfilment of my
warmest wishes, I had never thought it would be possible that I
should outlive this daughter. Nevertheless I bore the pain &hellip;
confident of being reunited with her.&hellip; For thirty years scarcely
a day has passed on which I have not at least once thought in my
inmost soul of my Caroline&rdquo; (pp.&nbsp;142&ndash;147).</p>

<p>I will cite in conclusion still one more fragment of self characterization:
&ldquo;A chief trait in my character was the need for love, not
that everyday love which limits itself to a personal pleasure and delight,
but that unbounded, overflowing love which feels itself completely
one with the beloved.&hellip; The ideal of marriage was before
me in youth, for this need for love has been mine all my life.&hellip; I
remember as a student having written in my diary that I would
rather forego life itself than the happiness of family life&rdquo; (pp.&nbsp;53&nbsp;ff.).</p>

<p>The center of this interesting life is Burdach's deep oneness with
his mother. She on her part took him from the beginning unconsciously
as a sexual object, as a substitute for her husband, who
was failing in health and soon after died. She lay in bed near her
little one, her arm twined about his body and slept with him until
morning. No wonder that the boy was so sensitive to womanly
charm and likewise that later different women looked upon him as
their lover. The thought early established itself with Burdach that
only such a relationship could satisfy him as that in which he had
stood toward his mother. And as he stood for the father it seemed
to him a certain fact that now a little girl should come to be the surrogate
for his mother. Noteworthy also is his attitude toward the
mother who had just been confined and the child. The former is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40">40</a></span>him almost incidental, while in the contemplation of his child, in
whom he secures his mother again, he can scarcely get his fill, and
he overwhelms her later with such passionate love as he had once
obtained from his mother. When the girl was torn from him, he
was consoled only by the thought of being united again with her in
heaven.</p>

<p>We may see finally in the fond play in bed with his daughter a
repetition of that which he carried on with his mother, and we may
remember also that as a child he always slept with his mother.
From all this it seems to me a light falls upon the unexplained purpose
of Burdach's sleep walking. If this seems completely clear to
him but so objectionable that he not only concludes to keep it secret,
but, more than that, forgets it on the spot, then the probability is,
that he desired that night to climb into bed with his beloved mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 7.</span> A second autobiographical account of repeated sleep
walking I find in the &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Buch der Kindheit</span>,&rdquo; the first volume of Ludwig
Ganghofer's &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lebenslauf eines Optimisten</span>.&rdquo; When the boy
had to go away to school his mother gave him four balls of yarn to
take with him, so that he might mend his own clothing and underwear.
She had hidden a gulden deep within each ball, a proof of
mother love, which he later discovered. In the course of time while
at the school the impulses of puberty began to stir in him and pressed
upon him so strongly at first that frequent pollutions occurred. He
thought he must surely be ill, until finally a colleague explained to
him that this was on the contrary a special sign of health. This
calmed him and now he could sleep splendidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One night I awoke suddenly as if roused by a burning heat.
I experienced a horrible suffering and believed I felt a hand on my
body. I cried out and pushed with my feet, and as I lay there in a
half consciousness it was as if many of my dormitory companions
were awake and I heard them ask, &lsquo;What is it? Who has called out
this way?&rsquo; A voice, &lsquo;Some one has been dreaming!&rsquo; And another
voice, &lsquo;Silence in the dormitory!&rsquo; And all was gone from me as if
under a heavy veil. Once again quiet. Am I asleep or am I awake?
A wild beating in the arteries of my neck, a roaring in my ears.
Yet in the dormitory all is quiet. The lamp is burning, I see the
white beds. I see the copper of the washstand glimmer like red
gold. Must I have dreamed&mdash;an oppressive, frightful dream?
Drops of sweat stood out on my forehead. Then came a heavy
sleep. What was this? I rarely had days of depression or restless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41">41</a></span>disturbed nights. And yet in these weeks I entered upon this uncomfortable
experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One night I awoke. Darkness was round about me. And I was
cold. And I saw no lamp, no bed, no shining copper. Was this
also a dream? Yet my hands felt plainly the hard wood in front of
me. Slowly I recognized a number of vaguely outlined squares, the
great windows. Clad only in my shirt, I sat in the study room
before my desk. Such a horror fell upon me as I cannot describe.
I ran wildly up the stairs, threw myself into my bed and shook.
Another night I awoke. Darkness was about me. Again I was
cold. And I believed that I was again sitting at my desk. No; I
was standing. My hands however felt no wood, my eyes found not
the gray windows. As I moved, my head struck against something
hard. I became aware of a feeble light shining. As I went towards
it, I came from some dark room upon the dimly lighted stair landing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I awoke again in the night. I was cold. A semi-darkness was
about me and over me many stars twinkled. I sat upon the shingle
roof of the bowling alley. It was not a far leap to the ground
below. But the pebble stones of the seminary garden pricked my
bare feet. Moreover, when I wanted to get into the house, I found
the gate closed. My God! how had I then come out? Somewhere
I found an open window and climbed into the house and noiselessly
up to the dormitory. The window near my bed stood open&mdash;and
there outside, I believe, was a lightning rod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All day I racked my brains to find a way to escape from the
fear of this dreadful thing. I dared not confide in anyone, for fear
of the ridicule of the others, for fear&mdash;I never knew just what I
feared. In the evening I took one of Mother's balls of yarn to bed
with me, bound two double strands about my wrists and tied the
ends around the knobs of the bedstead. In the night, as I was about
to wander again, I felt the pull of Mother's threads and awoke. It
never came again. I was cured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This appears at the first glance a non-sexual sleep walking. This
is only however in its first appearance, although it is to be regretted
that the full explanation can scarcely be given in the absence of any
analysis. It is first to be noted that sleep walking sets in at puberty
and is ushered in by anxiety dreams, pollutions and various anxiety
equivalents. The hammering in the arteries, the roaring in the ears,
the restless, disturbed nights, as well as the unusually disturbed
days, we know these all as manifestations of an unsatisfied libido.
The first &ldquo;frightful&rdquo; anxiety dream seems to lead deeper, as well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42">42</a></span>as the &ldquo;horrible suffering&rdquo; started by a hand, which he felt upon
his body. Must not this hand, which causes this &ldquo;horrible suffering&rdquo;
to the youth who had never yet known trouble, have touched
his genitals?<a name="FNanchor_17_18" href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Behind this perhaps, moreover, are very early
memories of the care bestowed upon the nursing infant and the
child.</p>

<p>The terror which fell upon him every time that he walked in his
sleep is worthy of note, for he was not otherwise easily frightened.
&ldquo;A terror which I could not describe,&rdquo; &ldquo;fear of that dreadful
thing&rdquo; and fear not merely of the ridicule of his fellows but of
something, what, he never knew, which is a far more violent reaction
than we have been accustomed to find with sleep walkers.
This excessive reaction may be very well understood, however, if
behind it a particularly inacceptable sexual factor hides itself.
Finally the cure by means of the mother's balls of yarn, homely
proof of her love, doubtless has to do with the erotic. It must be
admitted to be sure that we have to confine ourselves to mere conjectures.
Only one may well maintain that even an apparently non-sexual
case soon reveals its sexual grounding. Moreover, a strong
muscle erotic is demonstrated further throughout Ganghofer's
autobiography.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 8.</span> I will now, especially upon the subject of moon walking,
cite an author who shows a very unusual preference for this
heavenly body. In many a description and in many of the speeches
which he has put into the mouths of his heroes, has Ludwig Tieck,
who also has sung of the &ldquo;moon-lustered magic night,&rdquo; given artistic
expression to this quite remarkable love mania&mdash;this is the
correct designation for it. Ricarda Huch in her &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Blütezeit der
Romantik</span>&rdquo; makes the striking statement that from this poet's
figures one must &ldquo;tear away the labels stuck upon them and name
them altogether Ludwig Tieck, for in truth they are only refractions
of this one beam.&rdquo; One may hear for example how Sternbald
felt: &ldquo;The orb of the moon stood exactly opposite the window of
his room.&rdquo; He watched it with longing eyes, he sought upon the
shining disk and in the spots upon it mountains and forests, wonderful
castles and enchanted flowers and fragrant trees. He believed
that he saw lakes with shining swans which were drawing
boats, a skiff which carried him and his beloved, while about them
charming mermaids blew upon their twisted conchs and stretched
their arms filled with water lilies over into the bark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43">43</a></span>&ldquo;Ah, there, there!&rdquo; he would call out, &ldquo;is perchance the home of
all desire, all wishes; therefore there falls upon us so sweet a melancholy,
so soft a charm, when that still light, full and golden, floats
upon the heavens and pours down its silver light upon us. Yes, it
awaits us and prepares for us our happiness, and for this reason
its sorrowful look toward us, that we must still remain in this
earthly twilight.&rdquo; The similarity here with the phantasies of the
psychoanalytic patient at the beginning is indeed unmistakable.</p>

<p>Yet one or two extracts from the novel &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Mondsüchtige</span>,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_18_19" href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
the title of which is misleading since it in no way treats of one
afflicted with lunacy but of a <ins title="vertable">veritable</ins> moon lover, presumably our
poet himself. There the nephew, Ludwig Licht(!), writes to his
uncle: &ldquo;It is now three months since I had a very serious quarrel
with my friend, a quarrel which almost separated us, for he mocked
at an entire world which is to me so immeasurably precious. In a
word, he railed at the moon and would not admit that the magic
light with which it shines was anything beautiful or exalting.
From Ossian to Siegwart he reviled a susceptibility toward the
moon although the poets express it, and he almost had declared in
plain words that if there were a hell, it certainly would be located in
the moon. At any rate he thought that the entire sphere of the
moon consists of burned out craters, water could not be found upon
it, and hardly any plant life, and the wan, unwholesome reflection
of a borrowed light would bring us sickness, madness, ruin of fruits
and grains, and he who is already foolish will without doubt behave
himself worst at the time of full moon.&hellip; What concern is it of
mine what the astronomers have discovered in the moon or what
they will yet discover?&hellip; It may be ludicrous and vexatious to
devote oneself exclusively and unreservedly to this or that, any
observation, any favorite object. Upon my earlier wanderings I
met a rich Englishman who traveled only to waterfalls and battlefields.
Ridiculously enough, though I have not journeyed only in
the moonlight, yet I have from my earliest youth forever taken
note of the influence of its light, have never in any region missed
the light of the full moon and I dream of being, not quite an Endymion,
but yet a favorite of the moon. When it returns, its orb little
by little growing full, I cannot suppress a feeling of longing while
I gaze upon it, whether in meadow and woodland, on the mountains
or in the city itself and in my own room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the uncle answers him: &ldquo;It is true, you are moon sick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44">44</a></span>as we have always called you, and to such a one much must be
forgiven which would have to be reckoned differently to a well
man. I have myself however always inclined to this disease.&rdquo; In
fact the entire action, loving and losing, the development and solution
of the plot, takes place almost exclusively under the light of
the moon. At the conclusion, when the hero finds the beloved
given up for lost, he cannot refrain from the outcry: &ldquo;Yes, the
moonlight has given her and led her to me, he, the moon has so
rewarded me, his true friend and inspired panegyrist!&rdquo; I regret
that I find nothing in the biographies which would explain Tieck's
exquisite amorousness toward the moon.</p>

<h2 style="line-height: 1.5em;">PART II<br/>
<span class="smcap">Literary Section</span></h2>


<p>It is my purpose to bring also our beautiful literature to the solution
of the exceedingly difficult and obscure problem of sleep walking
and moon walking. Our poets, for all our psychiatrists and psychologists,
possess the finest knowledge of the psyche and during
the centuries before science was able to throw light upon the puzzles
of the mind, they solved them prophetically with discerning spirit.
Thus they knew how to bring to light various elements of our
problem. Their creations directed to that end arose from their
own inner nature, through analogy, or because sleep walking was
not foreign to them themselves. And even if neither were the case,
they still had the ability of those who have a real true knowledge of
men, quite intuitively to see clearly into the unconscious of others.
We will come to know what profound interest many of the great
poets, like Otto Ludwig and Heinrich von Kleist took in night wandering
and moon walking and how they have first introduced these
dark problems into other traditional material. A striking similarity
is revealed if one compares that which the poet has in mind with
that which I have been able to report in the medical section. I
shall be able satisfactorily to verify the statement that science and
art have reached exactly the same result. First however I will present
the examples from the poets according to their comprehensibility
and their transparency. I begin with</p>


<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap" lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aebelö</span>,&rdquo; by Sophus Michaelis.</h3>

<p>Twice had Soelver drawn near to the maiden Gro, daughter of
his neighbor, Sten Basse. The first time was when in the spring he
visited the island Aebeloe, which belonged to him but was quite uninhabited.
So bright the day and so warm the kiss of the sun upon
him, yet suddenly it was &ldquo;as if his bare neck were flooded by a still
warmer wave of light.&rdquo; A maiden stood before him, &ldquo;who was
like pure light. The eyes were as if without pupils, without a
glance; as she looked it was as if white clouds floated forth out of a
heavenly blue background. Soelver sprang up and stood face to
face before her. Her cheeks grew red. Although unknown to each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46">46</a></span>other, they smiled one at the other like two seraphim. Her hands
opened toward his and before her, as out of her lap, fell the flowers
which she had gathered. Soelver believed for a moment that it was
all a dream. He swung his hands into the air and a hand waved
toward him. He closed his eyes that he might enjoy to the full the
soft, fleeting impression. It floated over his hand like an incorporeal
breath. Was it then a ghostly vision, that wandered there
at his side!&rdquo; When however he knew that the maiden near him
was a living being, then &ldquo;his lips sank toward her trembling with
desire, unintentionally and yet irrevocably.&rdquo; At this moment a
&ldquo;cloud passed over the sun and the light became at once dulled as if
a mist had fallen upon all the flowers. Of all this he did not become
so quickly aware, as that his own <ins title="checks">cheeks</ins> resounded from a whizzing
blow.&rdquo; Her face glowed bright with anger and the delicate blue
veins were swollen on her forehead, while with a scornful look she
turned her back to him. His blood was however aflame with desire
for revenge.</p>

<p>A second time had the young nobleman Soelver sought to satisfy
his masculine passion, when he surprised Gro bathing upon Aebeloe.
She however had defended her maidenhood and struck him about
the head with an old, rusty sword, which she found on the shore, so
that he sank upon the grass covered with blood. &ldquo;He felt the pain
of his wounds with a strange glow of pleasure. The blow had
fallen upon the hard flint stone within him so that the sparks of
passion had sprung forth. He loved the maiden Gro. A consuming
passion raged in his blood. In his thoughts he knelt always
before that ineffaceable image, which struck him to the earth with a
flame of divine wrath in her eyes.&rdquo; In revenge for the trespass
committed Sten Basse fell upon Soelver's castle and took the young
nobleman himself prisoner.</p>

<p>Wild violence of this sort was indeed familiar to Sten Basse.
He himself had once taken his wife thus by force. Just as he was
flattering himself that he had broken her will once for all, she bit
him in his chin so that the blood gushed forth and she spit his own
blood into his eyes. He was struck with admiration at such
strength. He had thought to desert her at once. Now he lifted
her in his arms, carried her from her father's castle into the stable,
bound her to his horse and rode forth&mdash;to his own home. Their
marriage had been at first a long series of repetitions of the first
encounter. In the end she loved him as the horse loves the iron bit
between his teeth and the spur in his flank. She did not allow herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47">47</a></span>to be subdued by the blows which he gave her, but she was the
weaker and she loved him because he was strong enough to be the
stronger. An evil fate had taken his sons from him one after the
other. Therefore he wished to call forth in his only daughter the
traits of his own blood, his pride, disdainfulness and stiff-neckedness.
&ldquo;She must know neither fear nor weakness; her will must
be hardened and her courage steeled like that of a man. When he
heard that his daughter had been in danger but had saved herself,
he swore revenge to the perpetrator of the outrage, yet at the same
time his heart laughed with pride at Gro's fearlessness. He took
the young nobleman prisoner and rewarded him with heavy and
tedious torture as penance for his insolence. Yet at the same time
he delighted himself with the thought of putting his daughter to a
still more dangerous proof. He wished to see the young-blooded,
inexperienced birds reach out swinging and scratching in attack and
defense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if in mockery he gave to the imprisoned youth the passionately
desired Gro to be with him in the dungeon. &ldquo;She stood there
as if she had glided into his prison by the flood of light entering in
and he trembled lest the light would again absorb her into itself.&rdquo;
He knew not what power forced him to his knees and threw him at
her feet with a prayer for forgiveness. She had however merely a
scornful laugh for the man humbling himself in his love and the
cruelly abusive word, &ldquo;Creeping worm!&rdquo; Then in his sense of
affront there comes the thought that Gro was given into his power.
While he tried the walls of his dungeon to ascertain if he was perhaps
watched, Gro stood and stared out by the aperture through
which the light entered, now paler than before. Soelver stepped
near her, drew the single gold ring from his finger, which had come
down to him through many generations of his forefathers, and extended
it to her as a bridal gift. But she threw it unhesitatingly
out through the peephole.</p>

<p>Now bitterness raged in Soelver's blood. &ldquo;He bowed himself
before her face in order to intercept her gaze, but he did not meet it
though her eyes were directed toward his. It was indeed no glance
but a depth into which the whole light of day, which was blue now
without overhead, was drawn down into a deep well. Soelver became
intoxicated with this light, which, as it were, appeared to seek
her alone and threw an aureole of intangible beauty about her form.&rdquo;
He crept up and pushed forward the wooden shutter, then carried
Gro to his cot. &ldquo;She had let herself go without resistance and fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48">48</a></span>lifelessly with her arms hanging down. Soelver laid his face close
to hers. His breath was eager, his blood was on fire and in his
fierce wrath he intended to yield himself to the boiling heat of sensual
passion. Her cheeks however, her skin, her lips were cold as
those of death. He began nevertheless wildly to kiss her face, once
and again, as if to waken warmth and life in the cold skin. Yet
with every kiss it was as if she grew more fixed, as if the lips
shriveled and grew cold and damp as ice over the teeth. The cold
from this embrace crept over Soelver, and drew the heat and fervor
from his nerves, until he shook suddenly with the cold and shuddered
with the thought that he had a corpse under him. Yet in that
selfsame moment he marked the rising of her breast as she drew in
her breath, full of strength with all its coldness, so full of strength
that it pushed Soelver away and he slipped down to the hard flags
of the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soelver lay upon the floor, congealed with a coldness which
was stronger than that of the hard tiles. It was as dark as in a
walled-in grave. He dared not move however for fear that he
would again feel that ice cold body. &lsquo;Hear me,&rsquo; sounded suddenly
a strangely shrill whisper, &lsquo;hear me, if you are a man, let me get
out! Call my father! I want to get out&mdash;make light&mdash;give me air&mdash;I
am almost choking&mdash;I want to get out!&rsquo;&rdquo; As Soelver opened
the shutter again so that the dim shadowy glow of the night could
enter, he saw Gro &ldquo;tall and slender in the pale light.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let me out,
let me out!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;I am afraid here below&mdash;not of you&mdash;but
of myself and of the dark&mdash;let me out!&rdquo; &ldquo;For the first time
Soelver heard a soft rhythm in this voice smooth as steel. A soft
breath breathed itself in her entreaty. He became a man, a protector
and felt his power grow through her supplication.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet though he exerted himself to the utmost to open the door of
his dungeon, it was all in vain. It must have been fastened on the
outside with massive oak or iron bars. <ins title="So">&ldquo;So</ins> finally he gave up entirely
and turned back to the opening where the light came in. Gro had
sunk down under the last bit of light, without complaint, without
sound. Her eyes were closed, she leaned her head against the sharp
edge of the aperture and her arms hung down lifelessly. Soelver
bent over her; her breath was almost inaudible, but irregular and
did not suggest sleep. Like a thirsty plant she stretched herself out
of the single airhole of the dungeon that she might seize the last drop
of light before the darkness extinguished everything. Soelver divined
that she could not be brought away from this aperture for light.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49">49</a></span>He brought all the skins from the couch, spread them over her,
pushed them under her body and &ldquo;solicitously, with infinite carefulness
he protected her from the damp floor, while he shoved his arm
under her for support without ever touching her with his hand. All
his brutality was gone, all his burning passion. Here she lay before
him like a delicate sick flower, which must be covered over from the
cold of night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Soelver awoke the next morning he noticed that one of
his hands was seized by her, grasped in the unconsciousness of
sleep and held fast by her long, slender fingers, which clasped themselves
about his hand. It was as if her soul clung to him in sleep
as helper and savior from him himself, from his own brutal savagery.
When Gro however opened her eyes and stared into Soelver's
face, lit up by the sun, she broke out into weeping which could
not be stilled. &ldquo;She was terrified at awaking in a cellar hole, into
the close damp darkness of which she looked, while the face of her
vanquisher blazed strong in the sunlight before her; she wept without
understanding or comprehending anything of what had happened
about her.&rdquo; Perplexed, Soelver bent over her hand and
kissed it. Then came Sten Basse and saw how uncontrollably Gro
sobbed. &ldquo;If you have gone near my daughter,&rdquo; he hissed at the
young nobleman, &ldquo;there will be no punishment strong enough for
you.&rdquo; At this there shot up in Soelver a wild lust for revenge and
he answered his enemy with irritating coldness: &ldquo;Yes, I took what
you gave. You brought her yourself into my presence, you laid her
yourself in my arms. Now you may take her back again. I spurn
your daughter for I have not desired her for the honor and keeping
of my house, but only for the entertainment of a night. Take
her back now! Take her back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless better treatment was from this time on accorded
Soelver, which he never for a moment doubted he owed to Gro. As
he dwelt in his cell upon his phantasies, he suddenly heard her voice
singing that melancholy song of Sir Tidemand, who tried to lure the
maiden Blidelille into his boat by vigorous runes written upon roses.
Blidelille awoke at midnight and knew not what it was that compelled
her.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;It drew me along to Sir Tidemand<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whom never mine eyes had seen.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In vain the foster mother bids them spread velvets and satins
over her that she might sleep. Notwithstanding she arises suddenly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50">50</a></span>dresses herself and goes down to the strand to Sir Tidemand,
who meets her scornfully. Then she goes into the lake, whither
Tidemand follows her, seized with heartfelt remorse.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;For evil the rune on the rose leaf traced<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And evil the work it had wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That two so noble, of royal grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To ruin and death were brought.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The woful song trailed itself through Soelver's mind like an
indistinct dream. Then he believed that he distinguished Gro's step,
until it was lost in her sleeping room. With his mental vision he
saw the maiden, as she looked out upon the lake toward Aebeloe.
She looked away from him, of whose fate she took no thought, but
gazed fixedly over the sea, which bore upon its bosom a ship with
silken sails, on whose deck Sir Tidemand stood. &ldquo;Then Soelver
was conscious of an infinite weakness in his love toward this pure
maiden, whom his coarseness had taken into his arms, his desire had
scorched with its hot breath but who had nevertheless left him benumbed
in his baseness, cowardliness and weakness. Now he understood
that love, in order to triumph, must first humble its own
power, still its own movement and soften its brutal will. Now he
comprehended that he must carve mystic runes of passion upon his
own heart as upon a glowing rose and fling it into the mighty sea of
feeling, praying it to bring the maiden Gro into his hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Day and night Soelver's thoughts tarried only with Gro. In his
phantasies &ldquo;he forced himself through the bolted door, climbed
sharp angled passage ways and winding staircases and lifted oaken
beams from barred doors. Without once making a mistake, driven
by a magic sense of direction, he finally reached Gro's couch, at
which he saw himself staring with great white eyes, whose pupils
in the darkness of sleep had as it were glided over to the side. And
upon the cover of her couch lay her two gleaming arms and the
fingers of the right hand trembled as if they grasped another invisible
hand. In this room Soelver remained until her sleep drew
him to itself, until the heaving of her breasts drew him down, until
her fingers entwined themselves with his, until their breath mingled
and his lids closed before her pure gaze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another time he dreamed that he was upon a vessel, evidently in
the rôle of Sir Tidemand. And Gro actually came over the water
to him like the maiden Blidelille, &ldquo;with roses like two blood spots
upon her breast. She had crossed her hands beneath them and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51">51</a></span>fastened her pure gaze upon Soelver, so that he was seized with
terror and, without escaping her look, fled to the lee of the vessel
to the edge of the ship. Yet Gro steadily drew nearer. Now she
reached the ship's border and Soelver retreated. Step by step she
followed him, the painful gaze of her deathly white face absorbed
by his own. And he withdrew over to the other border, drew back
until he felt the railing hard behind him. Gro stepped forward
alone and it was not possible to stop her; he felt as if she wished to
press within him like the sped arrow to its goal. Finally, in an instant,
as her garment fluttered against him, he threw himself with
a loud cry to one side and saw, with a great horror, that Gro went
forward, through the railing as through air and disappeared on the
other side in the sea, while Soelver lay moaning upon the deck and
saw before him only the red roses, which fallen from her breast
crept like living blood over the ship's planks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was it dream or reality, which he saw when he opened his eyes?
&ldquo;The sun's rays burst forth through a crack in a long, radiant arrow,
which bored itself into the floor and transfixed as it were something
red that began to glow.&rdquo; And as Soelver crept nearer his astonishment
grew deeper. &ldquo;For hard by the vision of red were footprints
breathed so to speak upon the floor, fine, slender prints, directed
toward him, no more distinct than if a warm breeze had blown away
the dampness from the surface of a stone, leaving the outline of a
foot fixed there.&rdquo; As he now stooped down and with his hand felt
for the blood red spot, his fingers actually touched &ldquo;a heavy full-blown
rose, whose sweet strong odor he drank as if in an intoxication
of reality.&rdquo; No one had forced his way in through the hatchway,
of this he soon convinced himself. Gro must have dropped it
here while he was spinning dreams about her.</p>

<p>In the nights which followed &ldquo;he slept in a kind of hunger to
feel her physically and tangibly in his arms.&rdquo; Then when it was
again full moon, he found on awaking, in a spot upon which fell the
rays of moonlight, a little gold cross, &ldquo;whose six polished stones
seemed to radiate moonlight from themselves. It was as if the
moonlight lay within his hand. He watched the small cross sparkle&mdash;it
was the same that he had seen in dreams upon her rose wreath.
Gro had been also within his prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was led out soon after this to be shown to the monk, who had
come to obtain news of his imprisonment. &ldquo;In the doorway the
young nobleman met Gro and drew back, so strong a power seemed
to irradiate from her living form. She stood in the half twilight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52">52</a></span>with her white hands and her white neck and forehead, which shone
as with their own light from out her coal black velvet robe. There
was a blinding, marvelous reality about her, which drew him like a
great fragrant flower.&rdquo; As the monk expressed his compassion for
him, that imprisonment had befallen him, his pride of nobility
awoke. &ldquo;What do you say of imprisonment and ill foreboding?
Know you not then that I am of my free will Sten Basse's guest?&rdquo;
This reply astonished even Sten Basse. &ldquo;He admired the young, undaunted
spirit, who found in himself no occasion for pity. Soelver
stood before Gro, his arms firm at his sides, and breathed deep and
strong. His eyes drank in the clear light from her hands and face.&rdquo;
When however Sten Basse sought to approach him in a friendly
manner, Soelver motioned him back: &ldquo;As prisoner was I led forth,
as prisoner I return of my free will. If you wish to make any
apology to me, you know where my dungeon is to be found.&rdquo; Then
he went quickly, without turning toward Gro, out of the hall and
down into his prison. His senses nevertheless had seized that warm,
radiant picture of the beautiful Gro and transplanted it to the midst
of his cell. He saw it streaming before his eyes in the shimmering
light of the cross of moonlight and longed for the clear light of the
night, that he might go on and make the dream face live. When
the darkness advanced &ldquo;he stripped himself naked and allowed the
air of the summer night to cool his limbs and purify them, before
he betook himself to his cot. The small cross he laid upon his naked
breast and watched the moonlight glimmer green and blue from
every stone&rdquo; and kissed it thinking of Gro. Then he fell asleep in
blissful happiness.</p>

<p>Suddenly however he awoke without any apparent reason, from
no dream or thought. &ldquo;He was awake, collected and yet at the
same time strangely under the control of something that lay outside
himself, a strange unknown power, which might be either mystical
or natural. It appeared to him as if the moonlight had been loosed
from the moon and now floated about in the room like a living
being. So real seemed this fancy to him that he turned his head
to one side and was not astonished actually to see a form standing
in the center of the darkness. A feeling of reverence and awe swept
over Soelver as little by little he distinguished in the floating folds
of the moon white garment, the firm outlines of a woman's arms,
which were crossed beneath a half bared breast, the line of the teeth
in the open mouth, a flash of white light from Gro's eyes gazing
with a certain fixed power.</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;Holy Mother of God&mdash;it was Gro herself!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53">53</a></span>&ldquo;Soelver started upright, frightened at his own movement, for
he scarcely dared breathe, much less go towards her. He felt his
nakedness as a crime, even his being awake as a transgression. The
form glided forward out of the moonlight, the crossed hands separated
themselves from the breast and Gro pursued her way with
outstretched hands, feeling her way and yet mechanically sure like
a sleep walker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she was walking in her sleep. Soelver recognized it by
the staring look in her eyes, which gazed through the night as
through miles of space. Soelver slid noiselessly to the floor in front
of her, afraid that he would be seen, in deadly terror lest she should
awaken. For he knew how dreadful it might be to awaken a sleep
walker and in his excited phantasy he heard already the cry of
horror and madness which would issue from Gro's mouth if she
awoke and saw herself in this dark, subterranean depth alone with
a naked man as with a demon. It was as if everything in Soelver
cried out in protective anxiety that Gro should not awaken. He
crouched beseechingly upon the ground, his whole soul was a sobbing
prayer for grace, for instant means of deliverance, now that
Gro had come to him as if by fate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There came a whispered sound from her open mouth, as her
lips for a moment sought each other. It was as if she breathed out
the one word &lsquo;Soelver.&rsquo; This, however, to hear his name spoken,
made Soelver strong at once. It compelled him to arise from the
floor, it banished fear from his soul, it made him rejoice in every
fiber of his being. The next moment her outstretched arm reached
his hand&mdash;he felt the firm, cool skin under his trembling finger tips
and his face felt the warm breathing of her voice, &lsquo;Soelver, Soelver!&rsquo;
And driven by some mystic power of will, he forced himself under
the same hypnotic influence which surrounded her. He compelled
<ins title="himeslf">himself</ins> to leave the clear broad way of reason and to enter the
ecstatic, perilous, paths of the sleep walker. He was no longer
awake. He sought, he touched, he stood before that after which he
had groped. He was himself driven by a magic power, by a marvelous
single purpose, which must be attained. This whole transformation
took place in him merely because he felt that this was
the only means of saving her from awaking to consciousness and
madness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Soelver&mdash;Soelver!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Soelver&mdash;are you&mdash;are you&mdash;there?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;here.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes&mdash;that
is you&mdash;that is you&mdash;I
feel you.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And you see me?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes, I see you.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And you will
stay with me?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes&mdash;I will&mdash;I will stay with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54">54</a></span>&ldquo;Soelver answered her in the same whisperings in which she
breathed out her words. His hands passed over hers with infinite
carefulness. But finally his arms closed about her neck and he felt
a marvelous tingling in his finger tips as he touched her soft silken
hair. His mouth approached hers and mingled his warm breath
with the breath which escaped cold from her lips. He drew in the
air with her own rhythm, it was as if his naked heart bowed toward
hers so that they all at once touched one another. Then the blood
flamed out of her cheeks and streamed over into his, although they
lay not upon each other. The blood burned in all her skin and
Soelver trembled for a moment lest this transport was the beginning
of the awakening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His heart stood still with fear. However the blood continued
to surge through Gro's body. She pressed Soelver close to herself
and through her soft clothing he felt her breast swell and throb, as
if she would bore herself into his flesh. &lsquo;Soelver&mdash;I love you.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Gro&mdash;I
love you.&rsquo; Then a strange giddiness seized him as if he
were rushing into her arms on a tower miles high. He breathed
upon her ethereal kisses, which closed her lips, moistened her forehead
and descended thence like a refreshing spring rain so that her
lids drooped. When her eyes were closed Soelver felt for the first
time quite secure. He fastened them with a real kiss and now,
since her sleep wandering had reached its goal in his arms and
Soelver was sure that her love dream was too deep to be disturbed,
he whispered louder than before, &lsquo;Gro&mdash;I love you!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Soelver&mdash;I
love you!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;How long have you loved me?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Longer than I
have known you, Soelver.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Why have you not said so, Gro?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;That,
Soelver, I will never tell!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Soelver carried his wonderful burden to his couch and inhaled
her youthful fragrance and lifted his mouth to hers and all
his blood at once leaped forth. Every fiber of his being was stirred
to kisses, every blood drop became a yearning mouth to meet the
thousand mouths of her blood. And lost to sense&mdash;vehemently,
seized by the divine power of nature, unafraid that she might
awaken, without control over himself and yet proud as a master of
worlds, he was impelled as the sunbeam to its goal, when it forces
open the flower and buries itself in its fragrant depths. Soelver
united himself with Gro. She on her part slumbered on, quiet as
the sea which has closed over its sacrifice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Soelver felt his senses reawakening. What now? Should
he let Gro sleep until day woke her and she saw herself in his arms?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55">55</a></span>He bent over his beloved in deepest distress. She must not awaken
in terror, not again weep as on that first morning when she was with
him. The most delicate chords in her soul had trembled and sung
to him in the night, to him whom she unconsciously loved with all
the indefinable conviction of her heart. This love must not be rudely
plucked and allowed to fade like a plant whose tender shoot is torn
asunder. She must go back to her maiden's couch until the flower
of the day had burst forth from its leafy covering. Then he discovered
that the panel at the foot of his cot was opened, while some
planking had been pushed back. Gro must have come this way and
by this way he carried her back. Led by an unerring instinct, as if
he knew from his nightly phantasied visits all the turnings of the
way, he went without deliberation into the secret room behind the
panel, found the passage to the main stairway, passed straight up,
turned through corridors, passed under the heavy tapestry curtains,
opened the last door and noticed first that he bore a burden when
he laid it down. The moon threw its faint silver light round about
in the little room. With a sweet wonder Soelver gazed upon the
prayer stool and the brown rosary&mdash;without its cross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I may pass briefly over the remainder. In the first place Soelver
was given his liberty and he went back to his castle. The death of
Sten Basse occurred soon after. Soelver whispered to his daughter
at his death bed, &ldquo;Gro, whatever may happen, know now that we
belong to one another.&rdquo; She &ldquo;turned her head slowly toward him
and looked at him with her large eyes swollen with tears. Her look
was that of a stranger and quite uncomprehending, so that Soelver
understood that she did not simply deny everything but she had no
recollection at all.&rdquo; So Soelver turned and went. For the first
time when bathing in the lake &ldquo;he found again his youth and his
freedom, his radiant hope and the jubilant certainty of his love.
Gro loved him! Only the thought of love had not yet arisen from
the depths of her soul like pearls to the light. Nevertheless the
wonderful flower of her affection was growing in the golden light
of dreams. He longed after Gro as after his bride, although he was
only the bridegroom of her dreams, who dared to kiss her only
when her eyes were closed. By day he was her foe, as the bear in
the fairy tale, who by night alone is changed into a beautiful young
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They met therefore first again at Sten's bier, at the side of which
they both kneeled. &ldquo;Gro's eyes were directed upon him as upon a
stranger, staring with wonder, burning with a mystic light. Why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56">56</a></span>was this stranger here near her, the man whom her dead father had
tortured and derided? And yet her eyes were wet with tears of pity
and she felt that this man only desired to take her hand. Soelver
observed her with his inmost soul. He pressed the small cross of
moonshine between his hands, he bent over it and kissed it and a
gleam from its blazing stones smote Gro's eyes. She stretched out
her arms and took the cross from him and gazed into the stones as
into well-known eyes. She knew not how this had come into Soelver's
hands but she also bent over it and kissed it and her soul went
out toward Soelver as toward a soul far, far away, whom she once
had known, whom however she could scarcely remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this Soelver came and went at Egenaes, Sten Basse's
castle, as if he were lord and heir of the estate. &ldquo;It was rumored
also among the tenants and the servants that he was betrothed to
the maiden Gro. Yet no word of it was exchanged between them.
Soelver stood by Gro in small things and great, and she allowed
herself to be guided by his strength and cleverness. Since that night
when he had kneeled with her at her father's lifeless body, she was
bound to him by a nameless bond of gratitude, of mutual feeling,
and by an inner apprehension that their fate was interwoven. Still
no consciousness of love colored Gro's attitude. She longed for
Soelver's strong handclasp because it made her will strong to withstand
her sorrow. She could think of herself lying upon his broad,
deep breast, only however because there slumber would come in
sure forgetfulness. There was moreover a tenderness in her look,
when in a fleeting moment she let her glance rest upon his, such as
the realization of another's goodness awakens in us, especially when
the goodness is undeserved and disinterested. Yet there was never
any of love's surrender. Only she was glad to know herself observed
by these quiet, steadfast, clear eyes, from which the red
specter of passion, which had so frightened her that day upon
Aebeloe, had long been banished. She believed that she had in
Soelver a friend given her for life and death, a friend who could
not desire her in love nor be desired, a brother whom one might
trust with infinitely more serenity than any lover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soelver was ever watchful of Gro. His eyes were on the lookout
whether he might not once surprise in hers the brightness of the
dream, and make the hidden rose of love break through the green
covering and bloom in reality. He longed thus within himself
once to see the day and night aspects of her soul melt into a
wonderful golden twilight. But Gro made no response to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57">57</a></span>gaze from his eyes. She turned her head aside so that her silken
lashes concealed her glance. &lsquo;Gro, why do you never look at
me?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I do look at you.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Do you see me with your cheek,
Gro?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I see you, though, Soelver. I see you with the outermost
corner of my eye.&rsquo; Soelver bent his face beneath hers. &lsquo;Are you
looking at me?&rsquo; But Gro pressed her lids together as before a
bright light and shook her head, &lsquo;No, Soelver, not so! You look too
sharply, you look too deeply. You look so deeply that it hurts me
very much. No, stand so Soelver, turn your eyes away!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Are
you afraid of me?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No, no&mdash;why should I be afraid? But I do
not feel comfortable to have you all the time wanting to read my
heart, to have your eyes searching for some writing that does not
stand written there. My friend and beloved brother, I fear what
your look would draw from me&mdash;what would you drag out from my
<ins title="soul?">soul?&rsquo;</ins>&mdash;&lsquo;The spring day, Gro, when we first met.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ah! Soelver,
I scarcely remember it. It seems to me that I have always known
you, that all your days you have been good and kind to me. Lately
I have felt it in my heart and upon my cheek, as when my mother
caressed me and that is long, long ago.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Gro, only say it, you are
afraid of the word, but not truly&mdash;just say it&mdash;you love me.&mdash;You
are silent because it is true.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, Soelver, I have never felt that.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;So
you have dreamed it, Gro.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Dreamed!&rsquo; Gro became fiery
red. &lsquo;Dreamed&mdash;dreamed&mdash;oh Soelver, what have I dreamed?
What do you know of my dreams? To have dreamed is to have
dreamed, and my dreams belong to me, to me alone!&rsquo; For a moment
she turned to him a shy, quivering look, then tears trickled down
from under her drooping lids. But Soelver observed that he had
hit upon the truth. Immediately however he regretted that he had
cast this look into the sanctuary of her soul. It was like the curious
peeping of which the knight had been guilty, spying through the keyhole
upon his wife, Undine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long time they sat silent. At last Gro was herself again,
quiet and controlled. Then she spoke in a soft but firm voice,
&lsquo;Soelver, if you remain with me to awaken me to love, then I beg
of you, go and never return. I can never look upon you with the
eyes of love. Passion seems to me like a glowing sword, which
burns out one's eyes as it goes by. There was a day when you
made the flaming sword of your desire pass by my face&mdash;since that
time it is burned out. I have been blinded, Soelver, I am blind to
the desire of your eyes, and all your fervent prayers. I have hated
you, despised you, defied you, yet you have repaid evil with good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58">58</a></span>and now I return good for good. Look not upon me with love's
eyes, seek not to awaken the dead in me to life. You are to me more
precious than if the proud brother of my childhood had returned in
you, your spirit is his, I did not believe that in the will of a man so
much kindness could dwell. Leave it so, stay with me as my brother,
or leave me like my brother, but never speak to me of love, neither
in words nor in looks for I know no reply.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young nobleman knew finally, for all his eager power, no
other way of escape than to go with the king to the war. He saw
quite clearly that &ldquo;Gro struggled against the force deep in her heart.
And yet the day's flaming sun could cause the weak chrysalis of the
dream to shrivel so that no butterfly would break through the covering
and rejoice in the strong light of midday. But with Soelver
away, the longing for him would support the invisible growth of
the dream and prepare the way for it into consciousness. Ah! it
was worth his departure.&rdquo; Then he took leave of his beloved.
&ldquo;Goodbye; forget me not on our island. Bid me return when you
will. The wind will find me, wherever I am. Tell the wild birds,
when you want me and would call me home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gro, remaining behind alone, first became aware what she had
lost in him and in his &ldquo;strong will, which was her source of light.&rdquo;
She began to long more and more for him who was far away. &ldquo;Ah,
if he would only come again!&rdquo; And when a bird flew by, she
&ldquo;flushed red at her own thought; was that a message sent forth by
her desire? This took place contrary to her wish and will&mdash;she
wished not to long for him, not to call him back, not to love him!
Angrily she roused herself and sought to recall the burning gaze
with which Soelver had wounded her modesty. So with a vexed
and hard stroke of the oars she pushed the boat away from Aebeloe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the war was ended, Soelver went to serve the king of
France. For, as he wrote in a letter sent by carrier pigeon, &ldquo;he
who is not summoned, comes not.&rdquo; Meanwhile love towards the
young nobleman had begun to grow in her bosom. &ldquo;Night after
night she dreamed of Soelver and at last one night she suddenly
awoke and found herself cold and naked, wandering around in her
room and heard the last note of her heart's unconscious avowal,
&lsquo;Soelver, I love you.&rsquo; There was a change within her. Hour after
hour would she sit inactive and half asleep, listening to the irregular
beating of her heart&mdash;something was drawing upon her very depths,
sucking her strength from her, from her proud will, something that
paralyzed her thought and bound her always to the same name, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59">59</a></span>same memory.&rdquo; As she listened to her own depths, &ldquo;she caught a
momentary something like a weak, quickly beating echo of her own
slow heart, a busily living little heart, that ticked louder and louder
until at last it deafened hers. A trembling joy seized her at that
moment through all her senses as she knew that she bore a life
within her life, that she enclosed in her body the germ of a new life
that was not growing from her alone and of her life alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly a crushing terror overcame her. Who was her child's
father? &ldquo;So abruptly came this question over her naïve soul that
she fancied for a moment that this might be the punishment of fate
for her longing for Soelver. This longing was desire, and desire
was sin no less than the love itself. Her wish for him had grown to
a fire in her blood and now she was stained by her own passion,
pregnant from her own sin. God's punishment had visited her and
soon would be visible to all the world. Gro saw however immediately
the foolishness of her thought. For one moment she lingered
at the thought of the one woman of all the earth, who had immaculately
conceived. Then she uttered an inward prayer that the
Mother of God would lighten her understanding and give her clearness
of vision that she should not go astray in her brooding over
this mystery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she questioned her nurse and the latter finally put it to
her, &ldquo;Have you spent no night under the same roof with Soelver?&rdquo;
then there occurred to her the many nights <ins title="when">&ldquo;when</ins> she had dreamed
of the lonely imprisoned man, who was being punished because of
her. When she lay in her bed in the dark, a strange curiosity had
overcome her to imagine his lot there below and, when sleep seized
her and dreams chased away the bitter, hard thoughts, her heart
had become softer and the sun had shone over the visions of her
dreams as the spring day over the woods blossoming with the green
May bells. Many a night and many a morning was she awakened
by a strange burning desire in her thoughts, and her mouth was as
though touched with fresh dream kisses, and she had entered into
judgment with her own weak heart and had so inflamed herself
to scorn and hatred that she had done nothing to soften the fate of
the prisoner. But how could Soelver have been the guest of her
dreams? And how had he been able to command the virgin love fed
by her slumber? Then came the nurse to her aid and made it clear
to her. She knew that the maiden Gro had walked in her sleep;
the servants had told of a white ghost on the stairs and once she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60">60</a></span>herself had seen it and recognized Gro, who had disappeared upon
a secret stairway, which led down into the dungeon. She had kept
still about it, for she thought it was a voluntary sleep walking to
the young nobleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus was Gro enlightened as to the source of her pregnancy.
&ldquo;She quivered with shame that the desire in her dreams had the
power to drive her down to the lonely prisoner and she shook in her
inmost soul at the memory of that happy dream, which she had had
the night before her father's death. Now her love suddenly burst
into the light like a wonderful flower, which suddenly springs up
with a thousand fragrant buds. Now it was impossible to stem it
or to conceal it. She had wanted to suppress every germ, with her
father's coldness and the day's dispassionately proud haughtiness
she had been willing to stifle every impulse toward love, every longing
for self avowal. Now she found her pride was dead and buried
and her being within and without was permeated by love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For she had loved Soelver from the first springtime kiss, which
he had imprinted upon her cheek as she wandered among the fresh
May bells, loved him in the blow which she had inflicted upon his
head when he had touched her chaste nakedness, loved him in those
nights when he had slept uncomplaining in the cellar dungeon, loved
him in those bitter moments of his humbling when he, in spite of
scorn and insult, maintained his pride, loved him that evening when
he kneeled at her father's bier and kissed the hand of his enemy
now dead, loved him day by day all the time they were together,
loved him in that hour when she saw his banner disappear among
the hundred others, and today upon Aebeloe when she heard that
new life singing within hers. And now she rejoiced; for she bore
him always within her, she could never again lose her Soelver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we glance over the material of this tale, we find as the nucleus
of the night wandering and moon walking the strong repression of
every conscious love impulse and the breaking through of the unconscious
in sleep and dream wherever the censor's rule is relaxed.
For the maiden Gro had loved Soelver from the first moment, yet
this love was confessed only in moments of occasional self forgetfulness,
as by the first meeting with the young nobleman, when her
hand met his, yes, even pressed it for the moment. Only Gro
should not have been frightened out of her half unconscious action
by a kiss or a passionate desire, for at once there arose to life within
her the coldness and haughtiness of her father and the highhanded
reaction which her mother had manifested to her conqueror. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61">61</a></span>determining factor, to speak in psychoanalytic language, is the
struggle between the strong sexual rejection and the equally compelling
sexual desire. At first the former held the upper hand with
our heroine in her waking and conscious action, the latter in the unconscious.
Through the force of her will Gro seemed cold, even as
she had learned of her father. She defended herself from her
lover's craving by force and blow; even when conquered finally
through the noble spirit of her enemy, she would see in him only
the friend for life and death. She directly refused to think of love
and displaced it to external things, she even bade the young man go
rather than desire her as his wife. Soelver's devotion reminded her
most significantly of her mother's tenderness, his pride, of the
brother of her childhood. &ldquo;It is as if in you the proud brother of
my childhood had returned. Your spirit is his. Leave it so, stay
with me as my brother or leave me like my brother, but never speak
to me of love, neither in words nor in looks, for I know no reply!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet she avoided Soelver's searching eye and as he reminded her
of her dreams, she was smitten in the depths of her soul. For her
dreams, she well knew, chased away the bitter and hard thoughts,
the repressed unconscious broke through and the true feeling of her
loving heart. This already appeared clear to her when her beloved
languished in captivity at her father's hands. The strange desire
to work out the fate of the young nobleman, who suffered on her
account, had overcome her lying there in her bed in the dark. And
in the morning she awoke with a strange burning desire in her
thoughts and her mouth was flecked with his fresh dream <ins title="kissees">kisses</ins>.
Still she consciously kept back every outer manifestation of love
and met the young man while her father was alive with coldness
and suspicion and later even merely as a brother. The great distance
separating her beloved from her and above all the child which
she bore from him under her heart for the first time conquer her
haughty pride and her conscious aversion. And as she dreams one
night again of the loved one far away she finds herself suddenly
awake, going about cold and naked in her room and perceives as
the lingering sound of her heart's unconscious avowal, &ldquo;Soelver, I
love you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So severe is this struggle between conscious sexual denial and
unconscious desire, that it even forces itself through in her sleep
and her night wandering. Her dreams had indeed, as she later
acknowledged with shame, the force and the power to compel her
below into the young nobleman's dungeon. She had clasped Soelver's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62">62</a></span>hand in her sleep, she had told him everything in the moonlight,
with eyes closed, everything which she secretly felt, and had
pressed him to herself. Yet when he asked her why she could
never confess to him that she had always loved him so deeply, she
repulsed him: &ldquo;That I will never tell!&rdquo; Even when he had united
himself to his beloved, she had slumbered on as if nothing had
happened and the next day knew nothing of it all.</p>

<p>This leads now to that which, according to folk belief, constitutes
the very core, the chief ground for sleep walking and moon
walking in a maiden. It is easy to understand the wish, on the part
of the female sex with their strongly demanded sexual repression,
to come to the beloved one and taste all the delights of satisfaction
but without guilt. This is possible only through wandering in unconscious
sleep. For, as my first patient explained, one is not accountable
for anything that happens in this state, and thus can enjoy
without sin and without consciousness of what is not permitted.
Convention demands that the maiden wait until the lover approaches
her, but in that unconscious state she may surrender herself. The
need for repression explains then the subsequent amnesia. Yet
wandering by night is not concerned merely with sexual enjoyment,
over and above that it fulfills a second desire that arises out of childhood,
as we know from psychoanalysis. Every small maiden has,
that is, the wish to have a child by her father, her first love, which
is often in later years defined thus, one might have a child, but without
a husband. The night wandering fulfills this desire to have a
child yet without sin. Therefore has that motive of an unconscious,
not to say immaculate, conception inspired not a few poets,
as it has already, as is well known, been active in the creation of the
drama.</p>

<p>Less transparent than that chief motive is the action of the light,
sunlight as well as moonlight. The heroine of the story stands
toward both in a special relationship. Her body is almost illuminated
by its own light, her hair sparkles electrically when it is
touched, &ldquo;warm waves of light&rdquo; emanate from her, which Soelver
noticed at their first meeting, the sun seems expressly to seek her, a
halo of impalpable beauty surrounds her and above all glows from
the depths of her eyes. Not only so, Gro seems to dwell chiefly in
the light, whose last drops she greedily absorbs within herself.
When the light fades, her body becomes cold as ice like a corpse.
In similar manner the shining of the full moon affects her, the light
of which the stones of her gold cross have absorbed. The first time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63">63</a></span>that the slumbering youth saw Gro wandering, it seemed to him as
if the moonlight had been loosed from the planet and floated only
in his room like a living being. The poet, to be sure, has offered no
explanation of this mystical effect of light and what the reader may
think for himself would be merely drawn from other sources. For
this reason I will not pursue this point further.</p>

<p>The narrative affords somewhat further means for an understanding
in another direction. It is not explained more fully just
why Gro follows the sunlight and moonlight or why both exercise
upon her a peculiar attraction, yet the tendency to a motor breaking
through of the unconscious may be derived from an inherited
disposition. The father is a rough, violent robber knight while the
mother shows distinctly sadistic traits and a truly ready hand at
fighting. That confirms what I explained in the first part, a heightened
muscular excitability and muscle eroticism, which strives to
break through again on the sexual side in sleep walking. Finally it
may be affirmed without doubt that the ghostly white figure upon
the stairs was no other than the maiden in her shift.</p>


<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap" lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jörn Uhl</span>,&rdquo; by Gustav Frenssen.</h3>

<p>I can deal more briefly with <ins title="Jörn">&ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jörn</span></ins><span lang="de" xml:lang="de"> Uhl</span>,&rdquo; the well-known rural
romance of Frenssen, in which the sketch of a moon walker constitutes
merely an episode. Joern Uhl, who, returned from the
war, takes over the farm of his unfortunate father, discovers Lena
Tarn as the head maid-servant. She pleased him at first sight.
&ldquo;She was large and strong and stately in her walk. Besides her
face was fresh with color, white and red, her hair golden and
slightly wavy. He thought he had never seen so fresh and at the
same time so goodly appearing a girl. He was pleased also at the
way she nodded to him and said &lsquo;good evening&rsquo; and looked him
over from head to foot with such open curiosity and sincere friendliness.&rdquo;
She sings too much to please the old housekeeper! &ldquo;She
is so pert and too straightforward with her speech.&rdquo; It is noteworthy
too that she talks to herself in unquiet sleep.</p>

<p>Lena Tarn can soon make observations also upon her side.
Joern was very short with the old graybeard, who advised him to an
early marriage: &ldquo;The housekeeper is with me, I do not need a
wife.&rdquo; Lena, entering just then, heard what the unmannerly countryman
said and assumed a proud look, thinking to herself, &ldquo;What
is the sly old man saying!&rdquo; Since however the old man began to
talk and compelled her and Joern Uhl to listen, she was concerned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64">64</a></span>almost entirely for the latter, whose &ldquo;long, quiet face with its deep
discerning eyes she observed with a silent wonder, without shyness,
but with confident curiosity.&rdquo; Not alone in the kitchen, which is
under her control, can Lena show what is in her. When a young
bull broke loose and came after the women, she met him with
sparkling eyes, &ldquo;Stop you wretch!&rdquo; When he would not allow
himself to be turned aside, she threw a swift look flashing with
anger upon the men, who were idly looking on, then swung the
three-legged milking stool which she had taken along and hit the
bull so forcibly on the head with it that frightened, he lunged off
sideways. &ldquo;Lena Tarn had however all afternoon a red glow
coming and going in her cheeks because the farmer had looked upon
her with the eyes of a high and mighty young man. That caused her
secretly both joy and concern.&rdquo; Immediately after this she experienced
one satisfaction. Joern Uhl was dragged into the water
by a mischievous calf and was much worse cut up by it than she,
the weaker one, the woman had been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lena saw always before her the face which Joern Uhl had
made when she had gone forward against the bull. She was
otherwise in the best of humors, but when, as in the last few days,
she was not quite well physically she was inclined to be angry. She
preserved a gloomy countenance as well and as long as she could.
Soon though, as she went here and there about her work and felt
the new fresh health streaming through her limbs, she altered her
looks.&hellip; Joern Uhl moreover could not be quiet that day. The
sudden plunge in the water had brought his blood to boiling. The
spring sunshine did its part. A holiday spirit came over him and he
thought that he would go into the village and pay his taxes, which
were due. On the way he thought of Lena Tarn. Her hair is
coiled upon her head like a helmet of burnished brass, which slips
into her neck. When she &lsquo;does things,&rsquo; as she says, her eyes are
stern and directed eagerly upon her work. When on the other hand
she is spoken to and speaks with any one she is quick to laugh.
Work seems to her the only field where quiet earnestness is in place.
&lsquo;That must be so,&rsquo; she says. Toward everything else she is angry
or in a good humor, mostly the latter. Only toward me is she short
and often spiteful. It has been a great joke for her that I had the
ill luck to have to go into the water with that stupid beast. If she
only dared she would spread it three times a day on my bread and
butter and say &lsquo;There you have it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now he meets old Dreier who gives him good advice: &ldquo;How
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65">65</a></span>old are you? Twenty-four? Don't you marry, Joern. On no account.
That would be the stupidest thing that you could do. I
bet you $50.000 you don't dare do it. Time will tell, I say.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take
it for granted that I will wait yet ten years,&rdquo; he answered. And he
went on thinking to himself, &ldquo;It is pleasanter to go thus alone and
let one's thoughts run on. Marry? Marry now? I will be on my
guard. After I am thirty!&rdquo; Then his thought came back to Lena.
&ldquo;She looked well as she flung the stool at the bull. Prancing like a
three-year-old horse. Yesterday she did not look so well, her eyes
were not so bright, she spoke harshly to Wieten (the old housekeeper)
and said to her afterwards, &lsquo;Do not mind it, Wieten, I
slept badly,&rsquo; and laughed. Funny thing, slept badly? When one is
on the go as she must be all day, one should sleep like a log. But
that is all right in the May days. It is well that men understand
this, otherwise every spring the world would go all to pieces.&rdquo; Then
he rejoiced that he was so young and could point out on the farm
what was his. &ldquo;Later, when the years have gone by and I am well
established I will take to myself a fine wife with money and golden
hair. There are also rich girls who are as merry and fresh and as
desirable and have as stately forms. It need not be just this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he came to the parish clerk who had just been notified that
day of six children to be baptized and who was complaining of the
increase in births. Joern agreed with him: &ldquo;What will we come to,
if the folk increase like that? Marrying before twenty-five must
simply be forbidden.&rdquo; &ldquo;With these words he departed, filled with
a proud consciousness that he was of the same opinion with so intelligent,
experienced an old man as the parish clerk.&rdquo; At home he
met Lena Tarn with an old farmer, who came to inquire after the
fate of his son who had been with Joern in the war. Then for the
first time the girl heard of the frightful misery and the suffering of
the soldiers which cried to heaven, so that her face was drawn
with pain. &ldquo;Deep in her soul however thrilled and laughed a secret
joy, that you have come back whole, Joern Uhl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later, when she was making out the butter account with the
farmer, &ldquo;she had to bend her glowing head over the book, which
he held in his hand. There came such a glistening in his eyes that
he wrinkled his forehead and did not conceal his displeasure at such
an unsteady flashing.&rdquo; In the evening she came to get back the
book. Then Joern spoke to her, &ldquo;You have not been in a good
humor these last days. Is anything the matter?&rdquo; She threw her
head back and said shortly, &ldquo;Something is the matter sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66">66</a></span>with one; but it soon passes over.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;As I came through the passage
yesterday evening I heard you call out in your sleep in your
room.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, well!&hellip; I have not been well.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What &hellip; you
not well? The moon has done that. It has been shining into your
room.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I say, though, there may be some other cause for that.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
say that comes from the moon.&rdquo; She looked at him angrily,
&ldquo;As if you knew everything! I did not call out in my sleep at all
but was wide awake. Three calves had broken out and were frisking
around in the grass. I saw them clearly in the moonlight. I called
them.&rdquo; He laughed mockingly, &ldquo;Those certainly were moon calves.&rdquo;
&ldquo;So? I believe not. For I brought them in myself this morning
and then I saw that the stable door stood open. I thought to myself,
the boy has gone courting tonight. Your eyes always sweep over
everything and light upon everything and you [du] worry so over
everything out of order, I wonder that you [du] have not seen it.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You
say &lsquo;thou&rsquo; [du] to me?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, you say it to me. I
am almost as great as you and you are not a count, and I am as intelligent
as you.&rdquo; She carried her head pretty high and as she
snatched the book from the window seat as if it lay there in the fire,
he saw the splendid scorn in her eyes. &ldquo;Take care of yourself
when the moon is shining,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;otherwise again tonight you
will have to guard the calves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had arisen, but dared not touch her. They looked at one
another however and each knew how it stood with the other. He
had again the look which he had revealed once in the morning, a
presuming look, confident of victory, such a look as if he would
say, &lsquo;I know well enough how such a maidenly scorn is to be interpreted.&rsquo;
But her eyes said, &lsquo;I am too proud to love you.&rsquo; She
went slowly into the darkness of her room as if she would give him
time yet to say something or to long after her. He was however
too slow for that and laughed in confusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night fell upon them, a wonderful still night. &ldquo;I will take
one more look at the moon,&rdquo; thought Joern Uhl and took his telescope.
He went through the middle door with as little noise as possible,
but the door of Lena's room stood open and she appeared upon
the threshold and leaned against the side post. &ldquo;Are you still
awake?&rdquo; he asked anxiously. &ldquo;It is not yet <ins title="late&rdquo;">late.&rdquo;</ins>&mdash;&ldquo;The sky is so
clear. I want to look at the stars once more. If you wish you may
come with me.&rdquo; At first she remained standing, then he heard her
coming after him. When he had directed his telescope to a nebulous
star he invited her to look in. She placed herself so awkwardly that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67">67</a></span>he laid his hand on her shoulder and asked her, &ldquo;What do you
see?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I see&mdash;I see&mdash;a large farmhouse, which
is burning. It has a thatched roof. Oh!&mdash;Everything is burning;
the roof is all in flames. Sparks are flying about. It is really an
old Ditmarsh farmhouse.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, my girl, you have too much imagination,
which is bad for science.&mdash;What else do you see?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
see&mdash;I see&mdash;at one side of the farmhouse a plank which is dark;
for the burning house is behind it. But I can look deep into the
burning hall. Three, four sheaves have fallen from the loft and lie
burning on the blazing floor. Oh, how frightful that is! Show me
another house which is not burning.&mdash;Show me a house, you know,
show me a farmyard just where they are who hunt up the calves.&rdquo;
He laughed merrily. &ldquo;You huzzy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you might well see
your three-legged stool in the sky, not? So, high overhead!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You
should have had the three-legged stool. I do not forget you
that day, you &hellip; and how you looked at me. That you may
believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had never yet let anyone share in his observations. Now he
marveled and was pleased at her astonishment and joy. And then
he showed her the moon. He placed her and held her again by the
arm as if she were an awkward child. She was astonished at the
masses on it: &ldquo;What are those? Boiling things, like in our copper
kettles? Exactly. What if it hung brightly scoured over our fireplace
and tomorrow morning the fire shone up upon it.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
boiling things are mountains and valleys.&mdash;And now you have seen
enough and spoken wisely enough. Go inside. You will be cold
and then you will dream again and see in the dream I do not know
what. Will you be able to sleep?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I will try.&rdquo; He wanted again
to reach out his hand to her but his high respect for her held him
back. He thought he should not grasp her thus, along the way as it
were. &ldquo;Make haste,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went and he remained to pursue his studies. So the time
passed. He had grown eager and busied himself noiselessly with
his telescope. &ldquo;And he thrust aside once more that young life,
which an hour ago had breathed so very near him and came again
to the old beaten track of thought that the old Dreier was right.
&lsquo;Don't do anything foolish, Joern.&rsquo;&mdash;And yet, &lsquo;Fine she is and
good. Happy the man about whose neck her arms lie.&mdash;What precious
treasure must those eyes hold, when they can look with such
frank confidence at a man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68">68</a></span>About him now were only the customary sounds of night. Suddenly
it was as if near by over the house roof and then at the side at
the wall of the house he heard the soft cry of a goose and the weak
flapping of wings. And &ldquo;as he looked, there stood under the house
roof in the bright moonlight a white human form, with one hand
over the eyes and with the other feeling along the wall, as if it would
enter the house where there was however no door. It spoke in excited
hurried words, &lsquo;The calves are in the garden; you must be
more on the watch. Get up Joern and help me.&rsquo; Joern Uhl came
in three long strides over the turf and softly called her name: &lsquo;I
am here.&mdash;Here I stand.&mdash;It is I.&mdash;So! so!&mdash;Now be still.&mdash;It is I.&mdash;No
one else is here.&rsquo; She was speechless and began to rub her
eyes with the back of her hand, as a child rubs the sleep out of its
eyes, and she fretted also in childish fashion. Then he embraced
her and told her again where she was, and led her to the stable door
seeking to comfort her. &lsquo;Look, here is the door of the stable. Here
you have gone through, you dreamer; you have gone all through the
stable in your sleep. Have you been seeking the moon calves? Ah
you foolish child!&mdash;So, here you need not be anxious. You will
straightway be back in your room.&rsquo; When she finally clearly recognized
her situation, she was frightened, flung her hands against her
face and uttered mournful cries. &lsquo;Oh, oh, how frightful this is!&rsquo;
But he caressed her, took her hands from her face and said to her
feelingly, &lsquo;Now stop that complaining. Let it be as it is.&rsquo; So they
came to the open door, which led to her room. It must have been a
remarkable night, for not only had half the calves in the pasture
broken out and in the morning were actually standing in the garden
and the court, but the boy this night of all nights had not come
home, but only returned in the early morning twilight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning Joern Uhl went to the parish clerk that the
banns might be published for him and the nineteen year old Lena
Tarn. He was almost embarrassed when he came again before her,
&ldquo;I should merely like to know what you think of me.&rdquo; As she remained
speechless, he came nearer. &ldquo;You have always been a great
heroine, especially to me. Hold your head high and make it known
that I am right.&rdquo; She was still silent, merely pressed both hands
to her temples and stared into the glowing hearth. Then he drew
one of her hands down softly from her hair, seized it and went
with her over the vestibule, through the door communicating with
the front of the house. She followed him passively, her eyes upon
the ground and the other hand still on her hair. In the living room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69">69</a></span>he led her to the large chair which stood by the window and forced
her into it. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said he softly, &ldquo;here we are all alone, Lena.
Here in this chair has Mother sat many a Sunday afternoon. You
now belong in it.&rdquo; Still she said nothing. &ldquo;I have been to the
parish clerk and arranged everything and the wedding will be in
June. Have you nothing to say yet?&rdquo; Then she seized his hands
and said softly, &ldquo;As you think, it is all good so.&rdquo; And she covered
her face with her hands and wept. Then he began to stroke her
and kiss her. &ldquo;Child, only cease your weeping. You are my fair
little bride. Only be happy again.&rdquo; And in his distress he said,
&ldquo;I will never do it again. Only laugh again.&rdquo; At last when he
could think of no more cajoling names, he called her &ldquo;Redhead.&rdquo;
Then she had to laugh, for that was the name of the best cow, which
stood first in the stalls. Now she lifted her head and gazed long at
him without moving. Thus Joern Uhl came rightly to that tenderness
and comfort which he thought he deserved.</p>

<p>I have only a little to add that is important for our theme. As a
young wife also Lena Tarn was busy the whole day, working from
early to late without rest. The work flew from her hand. And
when her confinement was over, she got up the sixth day, against
the earnest warning of the housekeeper, cared for her boy alone the
whole day, went even to the kitchen and carried water for his bath.
Joern Uhl allowed it. For he was proud to have such a strong wife,
&ldquo;not so affected as the others.&rdquo; It led however to her death. Somehow
she must have become infected, for soon after a severe childbed
fever broke out.</p>

<p>Even as a young wife she, the poor humble cottager's daughter
whose childhood was pinched by bitterest need, shed a wealth of
love and joy upon all who dwelt about her. Yet now, &ldquo;she, the
friendly one, who had never caused suffering to any one, went in
her fever delirium to every one in the house, even the smallest
servant boy and to every neighbor and begged their forgiveness, &lsquo;if
I have done anything to hurt you in any way.&rsquo; Towards morning
she became quieter but it was the exhaustion of death and she spoke
with great difficulty. Her husband must &lsquo;tell Father that she had
loved him.&rsquo; Joern Uhl sobbed violently: &lsquo;Who has never spoken
a kind word to you, poor child.&rsquo; She tried to smile. &lsquo;You have had
nothing but toil and work,&rsquo; he said. Then she made him understand
in labored speech that she had been very happy.&rdquo; The last
fever phantasies finally put her back into her childhood. Her love
went out to the old teacher Karstensen, then again to Joern Uhl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70">70</a></span>until she was finally led through angels to a further father-incarnation,
to the dear God. &ldquo;It came to her like peace and strength.
Clasped by many hands and led forward, she came to an earnest,
holy form who leaned forward and looked kindly upon her. Then
she stretched her hand out and suddenly she had a great bunch of
glowing red flowers in her hand. She gave them to him saying,
&lsquo;That is all that I have. I pray you let me remain with you. I am
fearfully weary. Afterwards I will work as hard as I can. If you
would like to hear it, I will gladly sing at my work.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scarcely in any other tale is the fierce strife between the clearly
active sexual longing, and the conscious sexual denial present at the
same time, as well as the final victory which the unconscious attains,
so plainly shown as in Gustav Frenssen's romance, where the
moon walking, exhibitionistic woman completely overthrows the
reasoning of the man. The poet expresses it clearly and decisively:
They each knew the desire of the other. Joern Uhl saw through
the meaning of a maiden's scorn and Lena's eyes said, I am too
proud to love you, but I do love you. Yet opportunity must be
given to the unconscious to break through victoriously so that the
inhibiting reason shall be deprived of its power. Therefore the
powerful increase of libido with the woman during the occurrence
of menstruation and through the wooing of the boy, who lets the
calves break out, in the man through the cold bath and furthermore
in both through the seductive May air. Finally the moon
acts directly with its light as a precipitating cause.</p>

<p>The night before she had spoken out loud in her sleep just as
Joern Uhl went by to his room. He had spoken of it directly as
the action of the moonlight, which she of course contradicted; she
had been lying awake and heard the calves break out.<a name="FNanchor_19_20" href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Then she
takes the following night, when the housekeeper, with whom she
slept, was sitting up nursing an old farmer and the boy had gone
courting again, to approach Joern Uhl on her part as a moon walker,
who knew nothing of what she did and could not be held responsible.
More than this her unconscious had a fitting speech ready,
the calves had broken out again.</p>

<p>The breaking through of the motor impulse is also well grounded.
Everything with Lena Tarn is joy in muscular activity, the restless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71">71</a></span>almost unappeasable desire for work and pleasurable &ldquo;getting
things done,&rdquo; &ldquo;exerting herself,&rdquo; the constant singing, the easy giving
way to anger. Work is the only thing which she can carry on
earnestly because in that she lives out in part her sexuality, she
meets every one else smilingly or angrily according to her mood.
It is noteworthy too that her unquiet libido transforms itself toward
Joern Uhl into anger and animosity and so much so that once in
anger she addresses him as &ldquo;thou&rdquo; and acts as if she were his
beloved.</p>

<p>One thing is especially evident in this example of sleep walking
and moon walking, the invariably infantile bearing of these phenomena.
When Lena, walking in her sleep, was called by her lover, she
rubbed her eyes with the back of her hand as a child rubs the sleep
from its eyelids and fretted also in childish fashion. Then again
there is her strange behavior when Joern announces that he has arranged
for the publishing of the banns. The farmer had in a significant
way put her literally into the mother's place and then in the
same manner shown tenderness toward her, stroking and caressing
her, as he himself had once been treated by his mother. Still Lena,
who already in the night responded to the sudden realization of her
position with the cry, &ldquo;Oh, oh, how frightful this is!&rdquo; cannot yet
quiet herself. It is hardly to be believed that a farm maiden would
so lose control of herself at the thought of an illegitimate relationship,
which furthermore was to be immediately legalized by marriage.
Many things however point to this&mdash;I mention only her
later fever phantasies&mdash;that she always felt inwardly guilty because
she had been untrue to some one else, the first beloved of her childhood,
her own father. Only when Joern Uhl on his part becomes
a child and in his way solemnly <ins title="declares">declares,</ins> &ldquo;I will never do it again,&rdquo;
and in the end names her &ldquo;Redhead,&rdquo; apparently a pet name of her
parent, then she has to laugh and looks long at him without moving,
wondering perhaps if he is the real father. After this everything
falls into proper place. I can now somewhat extend the statement
at the beginning of this section. Night wandering and moon walking
have not only inner connections with the infantile but more
exactly with the infantile erotic.</p>

<p>I will briefly mention still one circumstance in conclusion. The
influence of the moonlight is but little touched upon in our tale.
Joern Uhl speaks of it only once. There is on the contrary a connection
with actual occurrences, a recent cause for Lena's moon
walking. She has looked at the moon through the lover's telescope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72">72</a></span>and received instruction in regard to it. That wakens the memory
of the instruction of the old Karstensen, her teacher when she attended
the folk school, from which we understand that he appears
in the place of her father.</p>


<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap" lang="de" xml:lang="de">Maria</span>,&rdquo; by Otto Ludwig.</h3>

<p>Perhaps no poet has felt so deeply and expressed so clearly
what constitutes the fundamental problem of sleep walking and
moon walking as Otto Ludwig in his youthful novel &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Maria</span>.&rdquo; This
novel has, according to a letter from the poet, &ldquo;sprung from the
anecdote of the rich young linen draper, who was passionately
roused to commit an unnatural offence at sight of the landlord's
daughter laid out apparently dead in the room through which he
was conducted to his own. As a result of this, when he put up
there years after, he found her, whom he supposed to have been
buried, a mother, who had no knowledge as to who was her child's
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This anecdote, which he learned from a friend, took such a hold
upon him that he immediately wrote down not only what he had
heard but the first plan, although upon the insistent protestation of
that friend he did not work out the story as it had been first conceived
nor so glaringly. &ldquo;I saw,&rdquo; writes our poet, &ldquo;at first only
the psychological interest in this material. The problem was to
present the story as well as possible and this was indeed a significant
one for the narrator. A distinctly esthetic interest would not be
possible in conjunction with that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no doubt in the mind of the experienced psychoanalyst
that, when a poet is laid hold of in this manner by an anecdote, this
only happens because his own significant infantile complexes are
roused out of the unconscious. Also the transformations, not
unworthy of consideration, which the poet makes with the story are
highly indicative. The seemingly dead maiden becomes a moon
walker, the landlord's daughter is changed to the attractive daughter
of a pastor. &ldquo;Out of the linen draper there is finally made a cultivated,
artistically sensitive youth, who has in him much of Ludwig's
own personality&rdquo; (Borcherdt). The finished romance the
poet considered the best which he had so far created, it came nearest
to his ideal of a story. Although his attempts always failed to find a
publisher for the &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Maria</span>,&rdquo; the poet retained his love for this work
all his life and it was one of the few productions of his youth which
he occasionally still shared with his friends in his last years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73">73</a></span>
The theme of &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Maria</span>&rdquo; is, as indeed the significant title represents,
the unconscious, not to say, the immaculate conception. It is
unconscious because the heroine, drawn by the moon and walking
in her sleep, comes to her beloved and becomes pregnant by him
without a conscious memory of the experience. Furthermore the
analogy with the Mother of God becomes emphasized by the fact
that in a picture &ldquo;Mary and Magdalene&rdquo; described at the beginning,
the Queen of Heaven bears quite unmistakably the features
of the heroine of the title. The main event, with its results and discovery,
is developed out of the character of both hero and heroine
with extraordinary psychical keenness.</p>

<p>Eisener like Maria is the only child of rich parents. For both
love manifests itself for the most part rather unfortunately. Apparently
neither gets on well with the father and both have early
lost their mothers. Only Eisener even yet clings with deepest veneration
to the mother who taught him to revere all women and,
judging from his words, her influence upon her husband and the
son's desire still appears. &ldquo;Whatever of good there is in me, I owe
to women. The thought of my excellent mother restrained me from
many an indiscretion, as also the teaching and the example of the
wisest and best of men (the father). This gentle power which is
so sweet to obey and at the same time so full of reward! In loving
surrender it obeys the man, while its divine power rules the man
without his knowing it. The imperceptible but mighty influence of
her gentle presence has determined his decision before he has comprehended
it. It has fallen upon him in his anger like an angel
before his own strength could arm itself, it has turned him to what
is right and proper before he is conscious of the choice. Before
her clear look confusion cannot exist, the coarse word of insolence
sinks back unspoken into the shame filled breast. The brightness
of a lost paradise shines from her eyes upon the fallen bringing
pain and warning, the consolation of eternal pity smiles upon the
penitent. These are the suns about which the planets of greatness,
honor and beauty revolve, lighted and warmed by them.&rdquo; Maria's
mother on the other hand is not praised by a single syllable. We
do not discover when she died nor how old the little one was when
she lost her natural protectress. Only indirectly can one make
conjectures in regard to this peculiarly important point.</p>

<p>Maria was from an early age a marvelous child. &ldquo;She spoke
a language of her own, which only the initiated or a very poetic person
could understand. All lifeless things lived for her; she transferred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74">74</a></span>to flowers, trees, buildings, yes, even furniture and clothing
the feelings of a human soul. She mixed sense impressions in her
speech in the strangest fashion, so that she asserted of tones that
they looked red or blue, and inversely of the colors that they sounded
cheerful or sad. A girl a few years older than she named her the
blue song.&rdquo; Both phenomena, the attributing of life to inanimate
things, to which one speaks as to beloved human beings, as well as
the phenomenon of synesthesia, color audition and seeing of tone
colors, are as we know positively today, to be referred back to
erotic motives.<a name="FNanchor_20_21" href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;With Maria's seventh year perhaps, the tendency to play and
purposeless dreaming, which is always bound with such lively,
mobile phantasy, gave place, to the astonishment of all, to an exactly
opposite tendency. From this time she began to take root in
life with all the intensity of her nature. Already in her twelfth or
thirteenth year she looked after the father's household, to the admiration
of all who beheld her. A divine blessing seemed to accompany
everything which she undertook; everything increased under
her hands. She could in passing enjoy herself well in the idealistic
dreams of the poets and of her acquaintances, but her own peculiar
element was reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What had produced this sudden turn about? I cannot escape
the conjecture that here the death of her mother had a decisive influence
and with it the necessity to take the place with her father
of his wife. Her housewifely activity is noted first to be sure from
her twelfth or thirteenth year. Yet I am of the opinion that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75">75</a></span>had already in her seventh year begun to play this rôle&mdash;in which
year the death of her mother would be placed&mdash;only because she
was too small it had been under the eye of a maid or housekeeper.
My analyses of hysterics has taught me that so profound and sudden
a transformation of the whole character always takes place
upon definite erotic grounds and for a quite definite erotic purpose.</p>

<p>The earliest love of the tiny maiden belongs almost always to
her own father, who is in truth her first beloved. One can often
hear it from the child's lips, &ldquo;You know, Papa, when Mama dies
then I will marry you.&rdquo; That is in the childish sense meant quite
properly and literally. The early, premature death of the mother
gives reality to such infantile wishes, at least as far as concerns the
care of the house. As soon then as Maria may begin to play this
part, she fills it in a striking and inimitable fashion, although in
years she is yet a mere child. She is altogether the mother in the
care of a boy outside the family and this, as he quite rightly remarked,
laughing boisterously and heartily, even where it is not
necessary. Thus her first thought, when she spends her first night
banished from home, is of &ldquo;the poor father, who must go to bed
without the little services to which he is so accustomed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She possesses a maturity in the management of the household
which few elders have. Everything goes on and is done without
any one noticing that it is being done. &ldquo;Is there anything more
charming than this sixteen year old little house mother in her housekeeping
activities?&rdquo; says one of her admirers. &ldquo;Just look, let her
do what she will, she accomplishes it in the best way and at the same
time most beautifully.&rdquo; She is quite contented in the position
which she has made. Her eroticism seems completely satisfied.
&ldquo;She is psychically yet so little a woman that there is not the least
sexual inclination in the charm that infuses her and therefore her
bodily development is overlooked. There is also no trace yet of
that entrancing shyness which springs from the mere suspicion that
there must be something else about the man.&rdquo; A friend of the family
expresses it thus: &ldquo;When one considers the repose, the self
possession of her nature, the freedom from constraint and the spirituality
of it, one might almost believe that <em>she was not originally
of this earth but perhaps a native of the moon, which seems to exercise
more influence upon her than the earth</em>.&rdquo; Every trace of
dreamy maiden phantasies, which represent nothing but unconscious
love desires, was wanting in her. What she formerly possessed of
these was now completely bound with her care of the father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76">76</a></span>
Her erotic nature is for the time satisfied and needs nothing more
to veil it and has nothing to wish for. Therefore she has on the one
hand kept childhood's clearness of vision, before which there can
be no deceit, on the other hand unbroken contentment with herself
and all the world as well as the capacity to forgive immediately
every wrong suffered. According to the picture drawn by the poet
of the passionate nature of the father, which is capable of hurrying
him, the pastor, into reviling God, it seems to me plain why Maria,
if she suffered wrong, &ldquo;is distressed merely over the remorse which
the other one, she knows, must feel, when he has finally come to an
insight and to reflection.&rdquo; This is nothing else than the father's
voice, who had once done wrong to his child and had in a later
searching of heart repented of it. Maria, with such early satisfaction
of her feelings of love begged &ldquo;even as a child for nothing
which the parents had to refuse her. If she had any need it was to
be busy, to take care of the order and the nourishment of the house,
the satisfaction and welfare of the inmates. Where she could love,
she was happy and at home. Yet even the love for her father never
proclaimed itself passionately but always rather in unwearied attention
and concern for his smallest need, which only she might suspect
as well as for that which manifested itself actively.&rdquo; For herself
she scarcely had any wants. A piece of bread and two apples
satisfied her as her day's nourishment, which is typical for the hysteric
anorexia and perhaps merely signifies the unconscious wish to
cost the father as little as possible. Just one single characteristic
was wanting for her perfection, the soft, clinging, typically feminine
characteristic. This also becomes understandable when one considers
that all eroticism toward the father is inhibited in its sexual
goal, and may manifest itself only intellectually on account of the
incest barrier, at least as far as it comes into consciousness.</p>

<p>The womanly within her shall nevertheless find release through
the young Eisener. I have mentioned above how he hung upon his
mother. As the early inclination of the small maiden is generally
toward the father, so the first love of the boy is for the mother. It
is she who teaches him to love and to seek the woman of his heart
according to her own image. Later, just before puberty we might
say, the boy becomes acquainted with the secrets of sexual life, then,
clinging to certain impulses of his childhood, he begins to desire the
mother also in the newly acquired sense, while he begins to hate
the father as a favored rival, who stands in the way of this wish,
and develops a conscious antagonism toward him. He falls, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77">77</a></span>say, under the domination of the &OElig;dipus complex. Yet the wishes
toward the mother go as a rule no further, since meanwhile the
incest barrier has already for a long time been erected. Through
this the boy is compelled to submit the mother complex to a splitting.
For a moment the phantasy may come to him that the mother
shall conduct him into the sexual life&mdash;a feature not wanting in
any youth&mdash;but it is now decidedly rejected or more typically displaced
upon those women who make of love a profession and actually
take care to initiate the youth into the sexual life. For this
reason the remainder of the mother complex is idealized and the
mother transformed to a pure virgin woman, toward whom no man
dares direct his desire. Similarly is it with the loved one, whom one
chooses after the pattern of the mother.</p>

<p>So Eisener expresses himself warmly. &ldquo;Maria is not made for
love, only for <ins title="reverence.&rsquo;&rdquo;">reverence.&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>Yet without the child's craving for the mother<a name="FNanchor_21_22" href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> he would not
have become a compulsive neurotic,<a name="FNanchor_22_23" href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> with all the hypermorality of
the latter, pride in his moral purity and extravagant self reproaches,
even a lustful self laceration after he had at one single time been
overpowered by sensuality. Furthermore his lack of resoluteness,
decisiveness and courage is not, as he mentions, the result of his
myopia but of his neurosis. He has developed himself, out of an
unconscious rivalry, in direct contrast to his intensely narrow-minded
father. The latter was only a tradesman, who set his comfort
above everything, for whom art had value only in so far as it
increased his own enjoyment of life. So painting becomes the son's
chief delight in spite of his exaggerated myopia or perhaps just on
account of it. He bore his father's tyranny with difficulty<a name="FNanchor_23_24" href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and
with inner protest. His tendency toward the free kingdom of art
stood in contrast to him, and in the same way he sought on the
other hand a substitute for the mother in every woman. He offered
up for his sin the dreams of his youth when he first believed that
his moral nature was stained and became as a result, as even the
elder feels uneasily, an over obedient son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78">78</a></span>How had this so easily befallen him with a mother so deeply
honored! Around her spun all the boy's love desire and twined
itself about her, and all that lava heated feeling belonging so peculiarly
to the child alone. He had hung upon that idol the longing of
his heart, the phantasies of a power of imagination lustfully excited,
which is not indeed wanting in the best of children, although
commonly these are inhibited, and later even completely forgotten
because of restraining moral impulses. Therefore the memory of
the highly honored mother is awakened not only through Maria, the
pure one, but also through Julie, who comes into contact with his
sensual desire and the unclean childish phantasies slumbering in the
last analysis behind this. It is interesting how strikingly the poet
is able to point out that double emotion in Eisener's soul.</p>

<p>There the moral restraining impulses were first crowded back
by the wine plentifully pressed upon him, which he, accustomed
from his early years to moderation, could tolerate in only the smallest
amount. Now &ldquo;the sly Julie seemed to him ever more charming.
A play of glances began between the two, which appeared to
make the young hunter jealous. On the other hand Eisener himself
felt something similar when his neighbor on the left addressed to
the earnest Maria words which did not conceal the liking she had
inspired. He listened to her replies almost with fear and was delighted
that there was not audible in them the least response to this
inclination, and then he wondered at himself over this same division
in his nature. In Julie's dark eyes glowed a flame, of which he
felt how it kindled him and that its fire must attract more and more
to itself without his being able to defend himself from it, yes, without
his wishing to be able to do it.&rdquo; To be sure when &ldquo;the slender
Maria stood like a holy picture behind Julie, the alluring child of
the world with all her seductive graces sank low in value in contrast
to the former. He felt the need to be open with himself.&rdquo; Transparency
was a necessity to him from his youth, as an inheritance
from his wise mother. &ldquo;Then Breitung thrust with his glass
against Eisener's refilled one. Laughing and drinking he found
the motley interchange of the liveliest ideas outwardly, which already
had taken the place of quiet thought, soon becoming less and less
menacing and finally even agreeable and desirable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His sexual excitement, heightened besides through the plentiful
indulgence in alcohol and the general boisterousness, was brought
to a high pitch by an episode with the passionate Julie. Eisener
had to leave the room with her during a social game. &ldquo;A strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79">79</a></span>thing happened to him, for as he bent down in the adjoining room
in the dark to the quick breathing Julie, instead of her ear her burning
mouth met his mouth, and the soft pulsating form fell as if
fainting into his arms. Wrestling with himself, striving to keep his
senses, he seized her arm involuntarily and stood again with her in
the assembly room before he was conscious what it was all about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is not this behavior of the youth burning with desire peculiarly
strange? What if behind it there is fixed a memory perhaps of a
scene with the mother, who brought him to his senses by seizing his
arm? Yet, it might always be so for him, he had found the power
once more to withstand the hot temptation. Not to be sure without
subsequent regret. For when he later sought his room he could
not go to sleep and &ldquo;his phantasy conjured up again, as often as he
resisted it, that dark room about him and the bewitching Julie in
his arms. He regretted a thousand times, so much did he distress
himself, his joy at his instinctive flight, that he had not drunk that
sweet poison to the full, whose mere touch had brought his whole
being to this feverish pulsation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sought now to find cooling for his heated blood in the garden,
and in fact the fragrance of the flowers and the rustling of the
leaves so soothed his excited mind that gradually the sense of a
pleasant languor came over him. In a half unconsciousness he went
upstairs again and back to bed. He was just falling asleep when
he saw a white form enter, whose features he could not make out
because of his shortsightedness. As it disrobed and came toward
him, he first, as if seeking for help, reached with his hands toward
the side where his friend should be sleeping. He did not however
find him, he apparently had been put into another room. &ldquo;The
thought of being alone for the first time with a womanly being in
the security of night crept over him at first like icecold drops, then
like the glow of fire over all his nerves. His heart pounded audibly
as the figure climbed into his bed. The strangeness and adventure
of the situation was not fitted to work rationally upon the intoxicated
man, whose excitement throbbed into his finger tips. The
power of the warning inner voice disappeared with his reason and
the strife was brief before nature came off conqueror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have before this sketched Maria's character development up
to the time when Eisener came into her life. Yet one point may be
added. She had retained one single influence from her childhood in
spite of all change in her seventh year, which &ldquo;with the beginning
of maturity appeared only occasionally and as it were in secret.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80">80</a></span>The moon had been her dearly beloved and her desire; as a small
child she had been able to look at the moon for hours without intermission.
If she was sick her mother or nurse must carry her to the
window through which she might look upon the friend of her small
soul.&rdquo; About half a year before her acquaintance with Eisener
&ldquo;the moon had made its influence felt upon her sleep, as it had
before affected her waking. At the time of the full moon she often
left her couch, dressed herself and went up into the corner room
in the pavilion. Here she stood for some time and turned her closed
eyes toward the moon. Then she dropped the curtain, undressed
and lay down in the bed, which stood in the spot where she had been
used to sleep as a child. As soon as the moon had left the windows
of this room or shone through the windows of her present sleeping
room, she arose again, dressed herself and returned. She herself
knew nothing of these wanderings, and whatever was done to
awaken her during them was in vain. The physician thought that
these attacks of moon walking would disappear finally when maturity
was established, or at least at her first confinement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this picture from a layman are some new and striking features.
First is the love&mdash;one can call it nothing else&mdash;which the
child <ins title="betows">bestows</ins> upon the planet. Why is the moon her beloved and
her desire from childhood up, why can she stand by the hour looking
at it, why does she long when sick to be laid so that she can look
at it all the time? He who observes children knows that such extreme
love, which endures for years without wearying of it, and
finally that ability to stare steadily at the moon, must have a sexual
content, although naturally no one will admit this. Only when the
object, in our case the heavenly body, is sexually stimulating is the
love for it enduring for all time, undergoing no change, no abatement
of feeling for it. As Maria's erotism later found satisfaction
in her father, her love toward the moon steadily receded. But at
the entrance upon puberty her sexual impulse increased and she
began to wander in the moonlight. The love finally which Eisener
inspires in her, together with the strong sexual excitement, which
the fête the day before had called forth in her, occasions again an
attack, in which she surrenders herself willingly to the beloved.</p>

<p>The folk, like the family physician, have not a doubt of the
sexual basis of the moon mania with her as with individuals in general.
When puberty is established or she has a child of her own
the attacks will cease, is the opinion of the latter. The servant maid
Grete also, a living book of fairy tales among her people, explains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81">81</a></span>the moon wandering as nothing else than the result of an unsatisfied
sense desire. There was a young knight who had wooed a rich
woman of gentle birth. Shortly before midnight they were both
led into the bridal chamber. &ldquo;Yet hardly were they alone together
when a strange voice outside before the castle called, &lsquo;Conrad, come
down here! Conrad, come down here!&rsquo; And again it called, &lsquo;Conrad,
come down here!&rsquo; The voice sounded so plaintive and at the
same time so threatening. The bridegroom said, &lsquo;That is my best
friend; he is in need and calls me.&rsquo; The maiden said however, &lsquo;The
voice belongs to my cousin, who was found dead two years ago.&rsquo;
Then she shuddered so that the gooseflesh stood up over her whole
body,&rdquo; and she implored her bridegroom not to follow the evil
spirit or at least to remain with her until the ghostly hour was past
and the full moon was up. But he would not be restrained: &ldquo;Be it
an evil spirit or a good, no one shall call me in vain!&rdquo; &ldquo;And he
went out. The lady went to the window but could see nothing for
the darkness outside and for the tears in her eyes. Then the haunted
hour was over and the full moon arose and she waited and waited,
but the knight never returned. Thereupon she swore to take no rest
on a night when the moon was full until she had gone to bed with
her bridegroom. And as her first bridegroom never and nevermore
came back, so she waited for another, but there was no one who
knew her story who would woo her, because each one thought it
would fare with him as it had fared with that other. Thus she died;
her oath is however still unfulfilled. Whenever it is full moon, she
is looking out to see if any bridegroom comes and she laments sorely,
and holds her hands weeping toward the moon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this folk tale the exclusively sexual foundation of the wandering
is quite plainly expressed. The ghost makes use of a voice,
complaining and threatening at the same time, which the bridegroom
believes to be the call for help of his best friend, and the bride on
the other hand imagines it the voice of her cousin, who had been
found dead two years before, perhaps after she had taken her own
life because unhappy in love. Both may be driven by sexual jealousy&mdash;I
offer this as a hypothesis&mdash;which would not permit the
other sexual gratification which is denied to himself or herself, the
friend perhaps meaning jealousy from a homosexual tendency.
The ghost having accomplished its purpose at the hour of midnight
and in the light of the full moon, the lady swore &ldquo;to take no rest on
a night when the moon was full until she had gone to bed with her
bridegroom.&rdquo; That is the kernel of the entire myth, the naïve and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82">82</a></span>yet apparently conclusive folk interpretation of the riddle of moon
walking, at least in its most frequent form.</p>

<p>I have above taken it for granted that Maria's erotism was satisfied
through her care for her father. That must of course be understood
with some qualification. For she could play the rôle of
mother only as housekeeper, not as wife. The former is satisfying
therefore only so long, until stronger sexual impulses awaken
through external stimuli or, according to rule, through the natural
development of a maiden. When once that has come to pass, one
so disposed to it as Maria was, begins to wander in the moonlight.
Why then, it may further be asked, does Maria seek for her childhood
bed, if the goal and the aim of the wandering is the sexual
satisfaction of the maiden? In the case analyzed at the beginning
the compelling motive was a sexual self stimulation upon the mother,
in later years in the loved object whoever it was, male or female.
In most cases, since normal sexual feeling predominates, the aim of
the sleep walking is that of the folk tale, to go to bed with the lover.
That would explain without difficulty the scene of the union in
Maria's case, as soon as she had come to know Eisener.</p>

<p>But what lay specially at the foundation of her earlier wandering,
when no man had yet made an impression upon her? Or
was there perhaps one, in relation to whom sexuality is most
strongly forbidden, her own father? What if her erotic desire
toward him was repressed and the indifference which she had attained
was transferred over to all men? Much that is apparently
harmless is permitted to a child, which would be regarded with
horror in the adult. Many parents like to take their children into
bed early in the morning and play with them without any consciously
sexual thoughts and without suspecting how very often
they in this way stimulate sexual desire in their children. Frequently
also the mother or father visit the child before going to
sleep, lean over the bed, allow themselves often to press the child
passionately to themselves and count this asexual love toward the
child. The case analyzed at the beginning teaches us how much of
the grossly sexual erotic is concealed behind this, even if well hidden.
Maria likewise sought presumably in her sleep walking for the bed
of her childhood because her earliest erotism was bound with it.</p>

<p>This had already happened under the instigation of puberty,
before her heart had spoken. How is it now since she loves Eisener?
We must keep in mind her unconscious wish, to climb into the bed
of the man she loves, and on the other hand that Maria as housemother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83">83</a></span>knew well that he was not sleeping alone, but with his
friend, so only a compromise form of action would be possible. So
she goes up again to her childhood room, which lies in the same direction
as Eisener's sleeping room. There she first draws the curtain
aside that she may gaze at the moon, which increases the sexual excitement
with her, as I have earlier discussed. Then she undresses
before the mirror as she probably had done as a child, and moves
forward toward the beloved one, who after a brief struggle with
himself embraces her passionately. She nevertheless submits to
his caresses without response but also without resistance. For thus
alone can the fiction be maintained that she has loved without consciousness
of it and therefore also without culpability. It is not
difficult, according to the analysis of the first case, to understand
how she finally at the withdrawal of the moonlight gets up again,
dresses herself before the mirror and leaves the room as noiselessly
as she had entered it.</p>

<p>The later portions of the narrative must confirm my assumptions
if they are correct, that Eisener merely embraces the mother
in Maria and that she on the other hand knows well enough in the
unconscious both as child and as maiden that she wishes for that
which is sexually forbidden and knows whom she desires. Let
us see what the poet tells us. As Eisener awakes after the bridal
night, he is not at all invigorated and uplifted as otherwise a man
in like case, but psychically and physically cast down, as if he had
to atone for some great wrong. &ldquo;He strove to consider the strange
adventure of this night as the delusion of a fevered dream. Yet
that adventure painted itself before him, in spite of all his effort to
forget it, in ever more vivid colors,&rdquo; because indeed a wish of his
heart had been fulfilled through it. His inner unrest drove him
forth and, as walking about he met his beloved, he marveled &ldquo;that
Maria seemed taller to him today than yesterday, or rather that he
believed that he first noticed today that she was tall.&rdquo; What could
this mean except that Maria now seemed big to him as once the
mother had seemed to the small boy? Only he had first to embrace
his beloved, before he could perceive such a thing and give heed to
it. Maria herself, who apparently had enjoyed her pleasure only
in her sleep and unconsciously, and therefore knew nothing of it
all, had lost her frank manner with him, which she still possessed
the day before. She grew red at his look and drew the hand which
she gave him &ldquo;quickly back again in confused fear,&rdquo; without consciously
knowing why. &ldquo;The flower of womanhood which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84">84</a></span>slumbered in her too serene, too cold image, appeared in this one
night to have come with magic swiftness to bud and immediately to
have unfolded in all its fragrance.&rdquo; Maria herself pictures her
condition: &ldquo;That morning I can never forget. Everything was so
still, so solemn; the guests were all yet asleep. I had never been so
strong of heart. I felt that morning as if all my life before had
been only a dream and life was now just beginning. It seemed to
me that I had suddenly become grown up and was now for the first
time a child no <ins title="more.">more.&rdquo;</ins> Maria thus felt herself through the bridal
night to have grown up from the child to the mother, only, now, it
was for the lover who had taken the father's place.</p>

<p>Both Eisener and Maria conducted themselves further entirely
in accordance with their earlier unconscious wishes. The former
for example &ldquo;found a growing pleasure in representing his own
action, when it was really the effect of many circumstances acting
one upon the other, as the result of a cold, calm calculation on
his part.&rdquo; And was it not at bottom actually something like a calculation,
since he in his earliest childhood phantasies imagined
something similar for himself from the mother? It is only natural
that he now greatly exaggerated in consciousness the sin which he
had desired. Never for a moment did it occur to him &ldquo;to throw
any part of the burden of guilt upon that being who so closely
participated in it. His rightful feeling remained in regard to it that
he had this night given to a woman a right to himself, which he, if
she should demand it, could not dispute. It was a source of calmness
to him to look upon himself as punished, as it were, in this
manner.&rdquo; Only all <ins title="to">too</ins> evident! This punishment was in reality a
disguised reward, fulfilment of the infantile wish to win the
mother.<a name="FNanchor_24_25" href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> For this reason he had not been able earlier to withstand
Julie although Maria attracted him far more. For the former was
the indulgent mother of his power of imagination, the latter on the
contrary the proud, unapproachable mother of his real childhood.
Moreover, though he did not conceal from himself that his heart
belonged to the chaste Maria, yet he resolved, if Julie should convince
him that she had been the ghostly visitor, to offer her his hand
immediately. &ldquo;The doubt, whether she deserved it, which was near
enough at hand, he put from him as an excuse which he wished to
make so that he could believe that he might release himself from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85">85</a></span>that which he had to recognize as his duty.&rdquo; Maria however &ldquo;he
had in these days accustomed himself to think of as a being so high
above him that his love must profane her.&rdquo; Again the well known
splitting of the mother into the holy and the yielding one.</p>

<p>How did it appear at this time to her, herself? The first weeks
after that moonlight night the woman in her bloomed forth more
and more, in spite of the fact that her lover tarried at a distance.
Yet when in her body a new life began to develop and Eisener still
did not appear, she was seized suddenly with a hysterical convulsion&mdash;she
was wearing significantly the same rose-colored dress in
which he had seen her that morning&mdash;which lasted twelve hours so
that every one looked upon her as dead. The despairing father
threw himself across her feet and lay there&mdash;a situation which will
occupy us later&mdash;and Eisener, who was just now returning, was
driven by the bitterest self reproaches across the ocean. After
waking from her catalepsy Maria did not regain her former blooming
health but grew more and more ill, which the family physician
finally discovered as the result of her pregnancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good girl herself believed at first that what she felt and
what they told her was a vivid troubled dream.&rdquo; This idea will not
appear strange to us who know so much about moon walking and
that one does everything merely &ldquo;in sleep&rdquo; in order to remain
blameless. &ldquo;That she should become a mother seemed to her so
strange and wonderful that she appeared to herself as some one
else (this might well read, as her own mother dead at so early an
age) or as suddenly transplanted into another world with strange
people, animals and trees. The sound of her own voice, the tone of
the bells seemed to her as other and strange sounds.&rdquo; We may
bring forward in explanation in this place the case analyzed at the
beginning, where a moon walker had abandoned herself to all sorts
of dreams. In the moon must be living men of another sort with
other feelings, customs and manners, and the sexual, strongly forbidden
upon earth, must be freely permitted upon this planet. She
seemed to herself on account of her sexual phantasies already as a
child quite different from other people, as if she belonged not upon
this earth but upon the moon. Could not a similar thought process
have taken place with Maria?</p>

<p>I said of her father, that he had been her first beloved. And it
comes almost as an unconscious recognition of this when he, filled
with anger, calls out to her mockingly, &ldquo;Why do you not say that
the whole affair has come to pass out of love to me, to prepare for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86">86</a></span>me an unexpected joy?&rdquo; Breitung also enjoyed since her earliest
childhood her unlimited confidence only on this account because he
loved her as his own child. Therefore she looks up with all her
anxiety so trustfully and self confidently to this friend of her father.
But when Breitung also no longer believed in her and her father
turned from her with scorn it was &ldquo;as if all her blood streamed into
her eyes that, pressing out as tears, it might relieve her. Yet here it
remained and pressed upon her brain as if threatening its fibers.
With a strangely fearful haste she pressed her eyes with her fingers;
they remained dry; a cry of pain would unburden her soul&mdash;no
sound accompanied the trembling, convulsive breathing. The old
servant, who entered after a while, found her lying with her breast
upon the sofa pillow, her head thrown violently back,&rdquo; in hysterical
opisthotonos. &ldquo;The old man had loved Maria from her earliest
childhood&rdquo; and stood accordingly in the place of a father. &ldquo;He
clasped his hands together in distress. She recognized him and suffered
him patiently to bring her head to a less forced position. She
looked at him sharply as if she would convince herself that he was
the one she took him to be. His Kalmuck features seemed to her as
beautiful as the soul which they hid and seemed to want to disown.</p>

<p><ins title="The">&ldquo;The</ins> friendliness, the affectionate regard, which spoke so unmistakably
out of the familiar old graybearded, sunburnt face, did her
no end of <ins title="good.">good.&rdquo;</ins> Since she could not yet entirely believe she asked,
&ldquo;Is it indeed you, Justin? And you will still recognize me? And
you do not flee from me?&rdquo; At first the deplorable commission
which the old man had to carry out threw her back again. When
she had to understand that her father would not again set foot in
the pastor's house until she had departed, her countenance became
deathly pale and convulsive movements trembled in quick succession
over her delicate body so that the old man wept aloud, for he believed
that she had gone mad. His signs of distress, the faithfulness
and love which spoke through them, touched her so effectually that
at last the hysterical convulsion relaxed and she sank down. &ldquo;The
old man caught her up. He placed her on the sofa. She lay across
his lap; her head lay upon his left hand, with the other he held her
body fast that it should not slip to the floor. It seemed as if she
would weep her whole weary self away. The old servant held her
with trembling hand and heavy heart.&rdquo; Now the scene of childhood
is complete, except that the old man plays the rôle of her father.
So had Maria presumably done as a child when she felt too unhappy
and so also the pastor's throwing himself down, as we saw above,
over his daughter whom he believed dead, is not strange.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87">87</a></span>
When Maria had left the parsonage her first thought and silent
concern was how her father must now live without her care, even
that perhaps he would not be there any more, when everything had
later turned out well. Then she thought again of the time when
she would be a mother and &ldquo;her life seemed to her as a tale that is
told.&rdquo; On her journey to her new home there came over her ever
more strongly &ldquo;the feeling of her complete abandonment. All the
dear childhood memories, into whose protection she would flee,
turned in anger from her. With tears she cried to God for a heart
that she might love, some one for whom she might really care. For
it seemed as if a curse lay upon her, which estranged all hearts from
her. She thought with fear at her heart that the being to whom she
would give life might likewise turn from her, as everything had
done that she loved.&rdquo; Then a good fate brings to her the unfortunate
Johannes whom his crazy father wished to throw into the
water in order to preserve him for eternal happiness. At once
Maria assumes the rôle of mother toward the boy and now &ldquo;that
once more she had to care for some one, she was again the calm and
serene being.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What had so thrown her out of her course? It was not so much
the banishment from the father's house, not the contempt of all the
world, nor even of her very oldest and truest friend. She would
have been able to look beyond both of these, because her consciousness
felt itself entirely blameless. But she took so to herself
the truth that she was no more the loving, caretaking house mother
nor might play that part, that for a brief while she planned to take
her life. She prayed to God with tears for one heart only that she
might love, that she might actually care for. Since the care of her
father is taken from her she feels herself at first truly and utterly
forlorn, all the dear memories of childhood turn in anger from her
and a curse seems to rest upon her soul.</p>

<p>Why do all the memories of her childhood turn from her, if
she actually knows herself guiltless? Is this merely because the
father is indissolubly bound with them? If she still consciously
feels entirely blameless toward him, and if he openly did her wrong
from a false assumption, then should not the childhood memories
return to her? I think the solution must be sought elsewhere, in
this, that Maria knew nothing in clear consciousness of the happenings
of that moonlight night and could honestly swear to that, but
everything was known in the unconscious. Here is the sense of
guilt engendered, of which consciousness may know nothing, here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88">88</a></span>she knows well enough that the youthful Eisener has embraced her
and she has together with him deceived the father whom she first
loved. The goal of all moon walking is none other than to be able
to enjoy and still be blameless, it is blamelessness because without
accompanying consciousness.</p>

<p>The poet's words must confirm this, if this assumption is correct.
We will test them. The first night of her banishment Maria, while
going to sleep, thought first of her father &ldquo;who must go to bed
without the little services which he was accustomed to receive from
her.&rdquo; Then she thought of Breitung and the apothecary's daughter,
who had turned from her full of scorn. &ldquo;The young Eisener occurred
to her in the midst of this, she knew not how, and a sort of
curiosity whether Eisener also would have turned from her in so
unfriendly a fashion as Breitung. She pictured to herself how he
might have looked upon her now with contempt, now with friendliness,
as on that morning which she so gladly remembered.&rdquo; Also
an evident identification of the young Eisener with the father and
the father's friend, and flight from the loved ones who had cast her
off to him who had inclined to her as a friend.</p>

<p>Yet more convincing is a passage which follows. Maria had
born a son and &ldquo;the more she looked with joy upon the small infant
contemplating his sound and beautiful body, the more grew the need
within her, only instinctively felt at first, to have some one who
could rejoice in the child with her, not out of mere sympathy with
her, but because he had the same right to it and so that she could
rejoice again in his joy, as he might in hers. Without knowing how
and why, she thought again of the friendly and true hearted Eisener.
Her dreams brought his picture before her eyes in most vivid colors.
It seemed as if it were Eisener who should enjoy the child with her.
She hastened to him with tears of joy to lay the beautiful boy in his
arms, and when she now stood by him, she had scarcely the heart
to show him the boy. Then she cast down her eyes and said confusedly,
<ins title="&ldquo;See">&lsquo;See</ins> this beautiful child, Eisener, <ins title="Sir!&rdquo;">Sir!&rsquo;&rdquo;</ins> Maria knew quite
well in the unconscious that she had conceived her child from
Eisener and the sudden restraint when she laid the boy in his arms
is only a compromise with consciousness, which must not know the
facts, otherwise she could not be spared her feeling of guilt. Yes,
when Julie then came with her love child, which she had conceived
that same moonlight night from the hunter, although she really
loved Eisener, then &ldquo;Maria experienced, she knew not why, a gentle
aversion toward her. She said quietly, &lsquo;That in which one has
done no wrong and cannot change, one must bear patiently.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89">89</a></span>Soon however there awoke a desire in her &ldquo;for something new,
still unknown to her, which she nevertheless felt must come now.
It was the strange, fearfully sweet condition of the ripeness of love,
which had not yet found the object on which she could open her
heart. That night a need awakened, formerly repressed into the
background by greater pain, but which threatened now to outgrow
other desires and feelings in the undisputed possession of him.&rdquo;
Often she sat knitting and dreaming at the boy's cradle. &ldquo;There
was a fair at Marklinde. She went early in her rose-colored dress
into the garden and plucked wild hedge roses. She was startled
for she heard a noise behind her and she knew that it was Eisener
who was coming after her. She turned into another path; she was
afraid to meet him, and yet she wished that he would follow her.
As she bent low behind some flowers, she threw a hasty look behind
her. She grew rosy because he might have noticed the look, and
still it would have made her glad if he had noticed it. &lsquo;Yet if he
knew everything,&rsquo; she whispered to herself; &lsquo;but I could not tell
him, nor could I let him perceive it. I would have to say No, although
he understood it as Yes!&rsquo; Suddenly he stood near her; he
had seized her hand and was looking into her eyes. She bowed her
head, he bent toward her. It seemed so strange to her&mdash;their lips
touched&mdash;Maria frightened and blushing, sprang involuntarily from
her chair, as if what she was dreaming were real.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A strangely mingled feeling drove her from her chair to the
window and from the window back to the chair. She felt herself
stirred in her very depths by something which wounded her sensibility
as much as it excited her longing. She fled to her child. She
strove to think of something else; in vain. That thought continually
returned and gradually lost its frightful character. Soon she felt it
only as a sweet dread and so the idea received a double stimulation
while it woke the curious question, why and for what reason
she must really be afraid. And as she looked now upon the child,
it seemed to her so marvellous that she, mother and yet maiden,
knew nothing of the happiness of which this little life must be the
fruit. Julie's words were continually ringing in her ears, &lsquo;The
happiness which is granted him, has to be reckoned too dear.&rsquo; It
gave her unending satisfaction, to think of herself actually in such
a situation to the young Eisener that all her unhappiness was the
result of a joy which she had granted him, without knowing what
joy this must have been.&rdquo; I consider it superfluous to add a word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90">90</a></span>to complete the interpretation of these phantasies, which speak for
themselves. They confirm everything that I have said above, better
than any labored explanation. Later Maria came to know that what
had sustained her in the hours of her sorrow was nothing else than
that mysterious but certain premonition of a happy life with Eisener
and her <ins title="George.&rdquo;">George.</ins></p>

<p>And now back to the purpose of the analysis of all these tales.
What does it teach us for the understanding of moon walking?
First of all it confirms many of our earlier conclusions. The most
important thing, in the first place, is that sexual impulses lie at the
foundation, desire for sexual gratification, and that one apparently
acts in sleep in order to escape all culpability, while the unconscious
still knows all about it. The sleep walking begins, in accordance
with the sexual basic motive, at the time of puberty and lasts until
it is inhibited by the close of that period or in women with the birth
of the first child. It is further established that at the beginning the
bed of childhood is sought, the place of earlier sexual pleasures,
later however the bed of the loved object, who appears in the place
of the originally loved object, the parent. Finally, moreover, when
the night wanderer fixes his closed eyes upon the moon before
starting out on his wandering, erotic thoughts hide behind this,
which in turn go back to earliest childhood. The heavenly body
effects a sexual excitement not only through its light, but indeed
also through sexual phantasies which are bound with it. Lastly
folk myth knows likewise that the woman in white represents nothing
else than the maiden in her night shift with all her sexual
longings.</p>

<p>One thing more this novel also confirms, which our earlier discoveries
have already taught us, the abnormal muscle excitability
and muscle erotic. For Maria was seized with a hysterical convulsion
when her father's unkindness pressed itself upon her. It is
interesting that this abnormal muscle excitability, which manifested
itself in various muscular convulsions, was present with Otto Ludwig
throughout his earthly career. Already as a boy he often suffered
convulsive muscular twitchings, when he had exceptional
tasks to perform or hard thinking was required of him, and &ldquo;nervous
twitchings of the head&rdquo; are recorded of him when twenty-three
years old, also presumably a tic had won for him the nickname
of &ldquo;the shaker.&rdquo; Later moreover our poet suffered chronically
from convulsive manifestations of a lesser degree, repeatedly however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91">91</a></span>in a stronger, special form although only in temporary
attacks.<a name="FNanchor_25_26" href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>In other words, it may be said that Ludwig assigns to Maria
and the young Eisener a series of his own personal characteristics.
That is to say, not only was the tendency to convulsive attacks
peculiar to him, but also to fainting, and a compulsive neurotic and
hysterical tendency, the high grade myopia, a fondness for discussing
painting, talking with inanimate things,<a name="FNanchor_26_27" href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> colored audition,
as well as other synesthesias, and finally a special reverence for his
mother.</p>


<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap" lang="de" xml:lang="de">Buschnovelle</span>,&rdquo; by Otto Ludwig.</h3>

<p>The moon plays an important part in the romance just discussed,
even apart from Maria's night wandering, and a number of significant
events take place under its very light. We find this relationship
still stronger in Otto Ludwig's &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Buschnovelle</span>,&rdquo; briefly referred
to earlier, which I add here, though it really does not directly
treat of our problems. The heroine Pauline passed with many as
moon struck and her blue eyes &ldquo;have a strange expression of their
own. They gaze as aliens upon this world, as angels, which, transplanted
to our marvelous earth, belong to the heavenly home and
cannot find themselves amid this confused and agitated humanity.&rdquo;
Likewise his bride asserts of the count that he knows no other recreation
&ldquo;than to climb about in the night over the rocks and worship
the moon.&rdquo; This perhaps gave occasion to the rumor of a ghost
or at least breathed new life into an old tale.</p>

<p>A prince was banished under an enchantment to the rocks of the
gods. He had &ldquo;a face as of a person twenty years old or so, but
pale and quite transparent like moonlight, and he could be rescued
only through a maiden eighteen years old and as innocent as when
she came from the mother's womb.&rdquo; The count, whom his bride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92">92</a></span>deceived, became very melancholy over it and trusted no woman
after this. He learned to know and love Pauline upon the rocks of
the gods, where he was accustomed to wander in the moonlight.
When she believed she saw in him the enchanted prince and declared
her intention of voluntarily rescuing him, he stipulated that she
must climb down from off the rocks, down from the cross, without
touching them with her hands but holding her arms toward the full
moon. &ldquo;And that must take place tomorrow night when the moon
is sailing overhead, otherwise I must remain enchanted. When you
shall have climbed down the rocks, I shall be saved and then I will
make you my princess.&rdquo; One may read afterward from the poet
how Pauline then carried out her resolve&mdash;her determination alone,
sprung evidently from a great love, had already cured the count of
his sadness&mdash;how the count saved her and later wooed her.</p>

<p>Emphasis will be laid here merely upon two facts, first that not
only all important events happen in the light of the full moon, but
that also no other novel shows so many autobiographical features.
The most recent publisher of this tale, Heinrich Borcherdt, gives
this explanation: &ldquo;One can recognize without much trouble in the
portrait of the count with his well-trimmed beard the poet himself,
who at that time tended to great seriousness and to melancholy.
For this very reason the cheerfulness, gaiety and unrestrained
naturalness of his bride Emilie worked most refreshingly upon him.
Pauline in the tale exercised a similar influence upon the count.
What we know of Emilie Ludwig from without agrees likewise with
the picture of Pauline. Pauline's father suggests Emilie's father.&hellip;
The greatest weight will be laid upon the fact that we possess
in this work a poetic glorification of Otto Ludwig's love happiness
in Triebischtal. The rural life is reproduced in every detail.&rdquo;
Nothing unfortunately is reported in the different sketches of his
life whether and how far the poet and his bride allowed themselves
to be influenced by the light of the full moon. The striking
fact remains at any rate that twice in the course of two years he
spun out this theme and each time moreover with a strongly autobiographical
note. That cannot be sufficiently explained merely
through the influence of Tieck, whom he, to be sure, read diligently
in his youth.</p>


<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap" lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lebensmagie, Wirklichkeit und Traum</span>,&rdquo; by Theodor Mundt
(&ldquo;Life's Magic, Reality and Dream&rdquo;).</h3>

<p>In the seventh volume of the &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Euphorion</span>&rdquo; Richard M. Meyer
has exhumed a probable source of Ludwig's &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Maria</span>.&rdquo; It is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93">93</a></span>fictitious tale of the &ldquo;young German&rdquo; Theodor Mundt, which appeared
in his collection &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Charaktere und Situationen</span>&rdquo; in 1837, five
years before the &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Maria</span>,&rdquo; and shows in fact some external similarities
with this. Still Otto Ludwig expressly acknowledges a
tale told by a friend as the source, but gives no syllable of mention
to Mundt. I must say that it seems at least very questionable that
the latter's story was the model, although the Berlin literary historian
comes to the conclusion, &ldquo;A direct utilization would be here
difficult to dispute.&rdquo; I will reproduce the contents of this story, as
far as it touches our problems, as closely as possible in the words of
Mundt, although this story, which is contained in the collection mentioned
under the separate title of &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lebensmagie, Wirklichkeit und
Traum</span>,&rdquo; hardly possesses an artistic value.</p>

<p>The theological student Emil Hahn had, as one of his friends
states, &ldquo;lost life itself over his books and before his merry companions,
who would have initiated him into the true enjoyment of
existence, crowed many a moral cock-a-doodle-doo of virtue and
self restraint.&rdquo; On the ride home to his father and foster sister
Rosalinde he was urged by two student acquaintances to a little
drinking bout, at which he partook of more wine than was good for
him. The two comrades sang the praises of Rosalinde, whom Hahn
had left as a fourteen year old girl and who in the two years of
separation had blossomed out in full beauty. As Hahn returned to
the father's house in a half intoxicated state and met Rosalinde in
an adjacent room, he found at once, in contrast to his shyness of
former times, the courage to approach her. &ldquo;Ardently and daringly
he embraced her and the passionate kiss which he impressed upon
her maidenly lips was followed, as one lightning flash succeeds another,
by a second more lingering one, which was reluctant to leave
off.&rdquo; After he had for some time, again quite contrary to his custom,
held his own place at the large party which his father was giving
that very evening, &ldquo;he felt himself gradually seized with weariness
and the lively and excited mood, to which the wine he had enjoyed
had awakened him, began little by little to disappear with the
intoxication. He made his adieus in a dejected tone and betook
himself with heavy, hanging head to his room, there to recover himself
through sleep, which he could no longer withstand because of
his painful state.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was late in the night when Emil sprang from his bed. A
vivid dream seemed to have confused and frightened him. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94">94</a></span>stood half clothed in the middle of his room and stared straight
ahead as if trying to recollect himself. Above in the night sky
glowed the full round moon with a sharp ray seldom seen and its
white silver light pierced directly over the head of the youth walking
in his sleep. The room gleamed brightly in the moonbeams trembling
with mystery, which had spun themselves out in long, glimmering
threads over floor and ceiling. Emil had fastened his eyes
upon the great disk of the moon and staggered with uncertain steps
to the window to open it.&rdquo; While he stood thus there came a small
snow white cat&mdash;the cat is well known as a favorite animal of the
romantic writers&mdash;and spoke to him: &ldquo;I am come to congratulate
you on your bridal night. Yes, yes, I know well that you are married.
This is a beautiful night to be married. The moon shoots
down right warmly, and its strong shining stings the blood and we
cats also feel the impulses stirring in the whispering May night.
Happy one, you who are married! Married to Rosalinde!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emil, distracted, clasped his forehead. Everything which he
saw about him appeared to him changed and even the inanimate
things in his vicinity seemed in this moment to have been drawn into
a magic alliance. Everything, the very table, chair, press looked at
him, rocking themselves saucily in the bright moonlight, personally
and familiarly, and had to his eyes, arms and feet to move about,
mouths to speak with, senses for communication. At the same time
a fair picture rose before the youth deep out of the bottom of his
heart, at which he smiled longingly. It was the recollection of
Rosalinde and her matured beauty. She passed like a burning,
ominous dream through his soul and he felt himself drunken, trembling,
exultingly united with the proud but now subdued maiden in
a love thrilled bridal night. While he was thus lost in thought his
look was held chained by a painting, which hung on the wall opposite
him. Strange, it was Rosa's portrait and he knew not whether
this picture had just now arisen warm with life merely out of the
force of the idea which was kindling him, or whether it had actually
been formed over there in its golden frame by a painter's hand.&rdquo;
Then the cat mewed again: &ldquo;That is your young wife Rosalinde.
The moonbeam chases her; see how its brightness kisses her temples
unceasingly. The young woman is queen on her bridal night.
We will crown her, all we who are here in this room and owe our
life to the brightness of the moonlight night, we will crown her.
I present her for her bridal crown burning, tender desires.&rdquo; Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95">95</a></span>the May blossoms in the room bestirred themselves and conferred
upon her the bloom of fond innocence for her bridal crown. Also
the bird in the cage made himself understood: &ldquo;I give her for her
bridal crown the score of my latest melody. Harmony and melody
should be the dower of all young brides.&rdquo; Finally a cockchafer
also which flew in offered her for her bridal crown &ldquo;a pair of lovely
crickets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dreaming Emil, surrounded by these fairy treasures of
the May night, stood in sweet intoxication opposite the glowing
picture, bathed in moonlight, of the maiden to whom all this homage
belonged. The longer and the more vividly he pictured to himself
and leaned toward all the maidenly charms, which had allowed the
first passionate wish in the young man's phantasy to blaze up, the
more an impatience, almost consuming, pounding, benumbing his
heart, seized him, which he did not know how to explain and had
never felt before in his life. Like a seductively sweet poison the
delusion imparted itself secretly to him that Rosalinde was his
bride, his wife, and that this wondrously beautiful spring night,
bright with moonlight, was his wedding night. His heart swelled
with mighty, growing desire, youthful passion breathed high in him.
Trembling, fearful, wavering, longing, he still felt himself strangely
happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it seemed to him that Rosalinde's picture began to move,
as if the gleaming shoulders lifted themselves gradually and gently
at first from it. Then the delicate outline of the bosom rose as
the lovely form came forth, the face streaming with love bowed
itself in modest shame before him. The form grew larger, rose to
full beauty, stretched itself to life size. Smiling, beckoning, gazing
at him full of mystery, promising favor and happiness, she took
some steps toward him, then fled back again ashamed and as if
frightened, floated away with sylphlike movements to the door and
remained hidden behind it, yet peeping and looking out at the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not know if he should, if he might follow her. He was
drawn powerfully after her and yet he stood still and hesitated.
The bright moonlight seemed, like a fairy toward one enchanted, to
make merry at the loud anxious beating of his heart. He restrained
himself no longer; with a passionate movement he hastened with
open arms to the beloved apparition, desiring to embrace her, throw
himself upon her bosom, breathe out upon her his burning desire.
She fled, he followed her. She fled before him, but softly and
alluringly and he, intoxicated, rushed after her from room to room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96">96</a></span>unable to overtake the form flitting on with ghostly swiftness. Like
a star drawing him onward she floated there before him, his footsteps
were as if bewitched by her running, and thus she led him
after her, on and on, through a succession of rooms, so that he marveled
and thought himself wandering about in a great, unfamiliar
enchanted palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last he saw her no more, the lovely picture had suddenly
disappeared from him. He must however still hasten and hasten,
there was no rest for him. He no longer knew himself what he was
seeking and what he hoped to find. But now he ran upon a door;
it opened and he entered a small, cosy room in which stood a white
bed. Seized with a strange apprehension the youth drew back the
curtains with bold hand, and looked, astonished, smiling, burning
with bliss. There lay a beautiful maiden asleep and dreaming&mdash;ah!
it was Rosalinde herself. In the sweet forgetfulness of sleep, unveiling
herself like the outblown petals of a rosebud, she revealed
her most secret charms in lovely fulness to the eye of night. Emil
stood before her in the dear delusion of aroused passion and bent
over her. &lsquo;Is not tonight my bridal night?&rsquo;, thought he. He reflected
and the hot tumult of exulting senses tore him irresistibly.
Then he flung himself passionately into her arms, pressed his mouth
to her mouth in yearning kisses and clung closer and closer to the
warm, living delight of her charming form. He dared the boldest
work of love. The sleeper did not oppose the daring beginning; in
the power of a dream, like him, according to the myth, whom the
chaste Luna had seized, she seemed at first to yield softly to the
seductive moment. Only a glowing color suffused the tender cheek,
a gentle halting exclamation breathed through the half open lips.
The bright light of the full moon shone on high with its trembling
beams directly over the couch of the maiden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, now however she awakes from the strange troubled
dream. She opens her eyes, she shakes her beautiful head as if
she would free herself from the fetters of a dark enchantment.
With a loud outcry she beholds herself actually in the young man's
arms and sees alas! that she has not dreamed it. Wildly with all
the strength of horror she pushes him from her, springs up and
stands wringing her hands distracted before him, her fluttering hair
only half disclosing her frightened countenance. Then she calls
him by name in a tone indescribably piercing, painfully questioning,
&lsquo;Emil!&rsquo; He in turn, hearing himself called by name, falls at the
same moment with a faint sigh swooning to the floor. After a pause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97">97</a></span>he raises himself up, rubs his eyes and looks wonderingly about him.
He cannot comprehend how he has come here. The influence of
the moon has permitted the poor night wanderer to experience this
adventure. When he was completely awake and had come to himself,
he stood up and began to think over his situation. Then his
eye fell astonished upon Rosalinde, who continued to stare at him
speechless and immovable. Shame and anger adorned with a deep
glowing color the injured maiden, whose virgin whiteness had been
sullied by the strange events of this night. A dark, frightening
recollection of what had taken place flashed now like a remote,
faded dream into Emil's consciousness. The alluring spirits of the
night, which had buzzed around him, now mockingly stripped from
him the deceitful mask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go, go, go!&rsquo; called Rosalinde finally, who could no longer
bear his look. &lsquo;Go!&rsquo; she called and stretched out her hand with a
passionate movement toward him, as if she would with it jerk a
reeking dagger from her breast. &lsquo;Go, go!&rsquo; she repeated, sobbing
and beseeching. Then she hid her aching head with a loud outbreak
of tears. Emil slipped away heartbroken and in despair. He was
in such a state, when he reached his own room, that he would have
put a ball through his head, had there been at that moment a pistol
at hand.&rdquo; How Rosalinde then became pregnant and in spite of
her resistance toward Emil, still married him to reëstablish her
honor, how though after the wedding feast two acquaintances of
the young husband, whom he had not invited, played him so mischievous
a trick that he lost his reason in consequence, that deserves
no further rendering.</p>

<p>We find here also as the nucleus of moon walking, when we
strip from the foregoing all its mystical setting, the longing to approach
the love object and there to be able to indulge oneself without
punishment because it is done unconsciously. The literary historian
Richard M. Meyer regards it quite correctly: &ldquo;Theodor
Mundt believed that he had emphasized something new in his way
of presenting it. &lsquo;The influence of the moon had caused the night
wanderer to undergo this adventure.&rsquo;&rdquo; To be sure Mundt attributes
all sorts of mystical-romantic rubbish to the action of the heavenly
body.</p>


<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap" lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Prinz von Homburg</span>,&rdquo; by Heinrich von Kleist.</h3>

<p>Heinrich von Kleist also like Ludwig carried night wandering
and moon walking into material at hand. We know that Kleist not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98">98</a></span>long before the origin of the &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Prinz von Homburg</span>&rdquo; under Schubert's
influence occupied himself very much with the &ldquo;night side
of the natural sciences&rdquo; and Wukadinovic has made it also apparent
that the poet went still deeper, back to one of Schubert's
sources, to Reil's &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rhapsodien über die Anwendung der psychischen
Kurmethode auf Geisteszerrüttungen</span>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_27_28" href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> There he found a
number of features which he then interwove into his drama, although
by no means all that he permitted his moonstruck hero to
do. The matter of the drama is presumably so well known that I
content myself here with giving the mystical setting and the beginning
and end of the action.</p>

<p>Wearied with a long ride, the Prince von Homburg throws himself
down to sleep that he may obtain a little rest before the great
battle in which he is about to engage. In the morning when they
seek the leader they find him sitting on a bench in the castle park
of Fehrbellin, whither the moonlight had enticed the sleep walker.
He sits absorbed with bared head and open breast, &ldquo;Both for himself
and his posterity, he dreams the splendid crown of fame to
win.&rdquo; Still further, the laurel for this crown he himself must have
obtained during the night from the electoral greenhouse. The
electress thinks, &ldquo;As true as I'm alive, this man is ill!&rdquo; an opinion
in which the princess Natalie concurs. &ldquo;He needs the doctor.&rdquo; But
Hohenzollern, his best friend, answers coolly, &ldquo;He is perfectly
well. It is nothing but a mere trick of his mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the prince has finished winding the wreath and regards
it idly. Then the elector is moved to see how far the former
would carry the matter and he takes the laurel wreath out of his
hand. &ldquo;The prince grows red and looks at him. The elector throws
his necklace about the wreath and gives it to the princess; the
prince stands up roused. The elector withdraws with the princess,
who holds up the wreath; the prince follows her with outstretched
arms.&rdquo; And now he betrays his inmost wish, &ldquo;Natalie! my girl,
my bride!&rdquo; In vain the astonished elector, &ldquo;Go, away with you!&rdquo;
for the prince turns also to him, &ldquo;Friedrich, my prince, my father!&rdquo;
And then to the electress, &ldquo;O my mother!&rdquo; She thinks wonderingly,
&ldquo;Whom is it he thus names?&rdquo; Yet the prince reaches after
the laurel wreath, saying, &ldquo;Dearest <ins title="Natalie,">Natalie!</ins> Why run away from
me?&rdquo; and really seizes her gloves rather than the wreath. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99">99</a></span>elector however disappearing with his retinue behind the gates calls
to him:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Away, thou prince of Homburg, get thee back,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Naught here for thee, away! The battle's field<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Will be our meeting place, when't pleases thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No man obtains such favors in his dreams!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The prince remains standing a moment with an expression of
wonder before the door, then pondering descends from the terrace,
laying his hand, in which he holds the glove, before his forehead,
turns as soon as he is below and looks again toward the door.&rdquo;
Out of this state the Hohenzollern returning awakens him. At
the word &ldquo;Arthur&rdquo; the moonstruck prince collapses. &ldquo;No better
could a bullet have been aimed.&rdquo; Afterward of course he makes
up some story in regard to his sleep walking, that he had slipped
into the garden on account of the great heat. Only the princess's
glove recalls to him what has happened in his sleep:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 24.5em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;What is this dream so strange that I have dreamed?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For all at once, with gold and silver gleaming,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A royal castle flung its portals wide.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While from the marble terraced heights above<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thronged down to me the happy dancers all;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Among them those my love has held most dear.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Elector and electress, and&mdash;who is the third?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&mdash;What name to call her?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>For the name of the princess there is amnesia, as well as for
the reason for his moon walking. Then he continues:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 24.5em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And he, the elector, with brow of mighty Zeus,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A wreath of laurel holds within his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And pressing close before my very face<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Plucks from his neck the chain that's pendant there.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His hand outstretched he sets it on my locks,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My soul meanwhile enkindled high.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now again the complete forgetting of the loved one's name. He
can only say:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 24.5em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;High up, as though to deck the brow of fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She lifts the wreath, on which the necklace swings,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To crown a hero, so her purpose seems.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With eager movement I my hands outstretch,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No word, mere haste to seize it in my grasp.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Down would I sink before her very feet.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100">100</a></span>
<span class="i1">Yet, as the fragrance over valleys spread<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is scattered by the wind's fresh blowing breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Along the sloping terrace flees the throng.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I tread the ramp&mdash;unending, far away<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It stretches up to heaven's very gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I clutch to right, I clutch to left, and fear<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No one of all the treasures to secure,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No one of all the dear ones to retain.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In vain&mdash;the castle's door is rudely closed;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A flash of brightness from within, then dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The doors once more swing clatteringly together.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I awaking hold within my hand<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Naught but a glove, alas! as my reward,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Torn from the arm of that sweet dream caught form<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A glove, ye Gods of power, only this!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is evident that there is complete memory of the latter part of
his night wandering up to the name of the beloved maiden, although
he thinks, &ldquo;One dumb from birth to name her would be
able!&rdquo; Only once, when he was dreaming by himself, he was on the
way toward recollecting the repressed name. He turns even to the
Hohenzollern:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I fain would ask you, my dear friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The electress, her fair niece, are they still here<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The lovely princess of the House of Orange,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who lately had arrived at our <ins title="encampment?&rsquo;">encampment?&rdquo;</ins><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But he was cut off briefly by his friend, &ldquo;Eh, what! this long
while they've been gone.&rdquo; The same friend had however to explain
in detail later, when he appeared before the elector in behalf
of the prince condemned to death:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;When I awoke him and his wits he gathered,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A flood of joy the memory roused in him;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In truth, no sight more touching could you find!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At once the whole occurrence, like a dream<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He spread before me, drawn with finest touch.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So vivid, thought he, have I never dreamed.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And firmer still within him grew belief<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On him had Heaven a favoring sign bestowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With all, yes all his inner eye had seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The maiden, laurel crown and noble jewels,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Would God reward him on the battle's day.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>We see here plainly that the kernel of the supposed dream
belonging to the night wandering is wish fulfilment, desire for glory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101">101</a></span>and the hand of the beloved. It agrees very well with this conception
that the prince himself takes the laurel from the gardener's
forcing house to wind a wreath of honor for himself. He looks at
it with admiring eyes and puts it upon himself, playing the rôle of
being beloved, only the elector and Natalie come in to interfere.
The princess and the laurel, also love and fame really hypnotize
him and draw him magnetically. The prince follows them both
with outstretched arms until the elector and Natalie disappear
behind the gates. It seems to me very significant that not long
before the creation of this drama a crowning with laurel at the
hands of a loved one had actually taken place in the life of the poet
and that, as it is now generally admitted, Kleist himself stood as
the model of the prince. &ldquo;Two of the smallest, daintiest hands in
Dresden,&rdquo; as Kleist relates, crowned him with laurel at a soirée in
the house of the Austrian ambassador after the preliminary reading
of the &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zerbrochenen <ins title="Kruges,">Kruges.</ins></span>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Broken Pitcher.&rdquo;) These
daintiest hands belonged to his beloved Julie Kunze, to whom Dame
Rumor said he was engaged. Wukadinovic defines quite correctly
the connection of the drama with its autobiographical meaning: &ldquo;As
the poet sees the ideal of love arising next to that of poetic fame,
so he grants to the ambitious prince, who exhibits so many of his
own traits, a loving woman standing at his side, who rewards him
at the close with the wreath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The matter goes yet much deeper. The prince says of the
elector: &ldquo;Plucks from his neck the chain that's pendant there.&hellip;
My soul meanwhile enkindled high.&rdquo; The laurel attains a further
value for the prince, because the elector binds his own necklace
about it. The latter is continually taken by Homburg as the father,
to which a number of verses testify. Since the prince unmistakably
stands for the poet, it cannot be denied that Kleist had desired the
reward not only from the beloved one, but this still more with the
express concurrence of the father. In the beginning to be sure he
is repulsed by him, &ldquo;Naught here for thee, away!&rdquo; and later on
account of his disobedience is even condemned to death.<a name="FNanchor_28_29" href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> He was
not only pardoned, however, after he had acknowledged his wrong
and recognized the father's judgment as correct, but when he believed
his last hour had struck, he was bedecked with the wreath
which he desired and on which moreover his elector's chain hangs.
Still further, the latter, the father himself, extends the laurel to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102">102</a></span>Natalie and leads the beloved to him. It is beyond question that
love is the chief motive of the moon walking of the prince von
Homburg, love to a woman as well as a homosexual tendency otherwise
authenticated in the case of Kleist. Only it appears here
closely amalgamated with desire for fame, something completely
unerotic, and with the sexual, as we have found it so far regularly
in night wandering and moon walking, quite excluded.</p>

<p>We will attempt to get more light on the last two points. The
striving after poetic fame does not remain with our poet within the
usual, normal limits but becomes much more a peculiar neurotic
<ins title="charactertistic">characteristic</ins>. No less a hope for instance had Heinrich von
Kleist than with an unheard of creation to strike at Sophocles,
Shakespeare and Goethe and concerning the last named he uttered
this audacious sentiment, &ldquo;I will rend the crown from his brow!&rdquo;
Since he fails to attain this goal in spite of repeated most earnest
onslaughts, he rushes away to die upon the battlefield. He writes
to his sister, however, &ldquo;Heaven denies me fame, the greatest of
earthly possessions; I fling back to it all else like a self willed
child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What lay in truth behind that unattainable goal that Kleist tried
again and again to carry by force? He himself confesses that it
was not the highest poetic art or at least not exclusively so. Otherwise
Kleist would have been able to content himself with his so
commanding talent and with that which he was able to accomplish
with it, like so many other great poets. Let us not forget that he
sought to outdo especially the three greatest. Therefore I think,
in accordance with all my psychoanalytic experience, that Sophocles,
Shakespeare and Goethe are together only father incarnations, that
Kleist thus wanted to remove the father from the field. One has a
right to definite surmisings on the basis of various works of Kleist,
although nothing is known to us of the poet's relations to his
parents. The incest motive is one of the chief determining factors
of artistic creation, as Rank has outlined in his beautiful book.<a name="FNanchor_29_30" href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
It is in the first place the desired and striven for incest with the
mother herself, in the way of which the father naturally stands.
The poet realizes in the freer land of poetry what is impossible in
life, by displacing it <ins title="over upon">over</ins> a discovered or given material.</p>

<p>I discussed in a larger work,<a name="FNanchor_30_31" href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> previous to Rank's book, how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103">103</a></span>Heinrich von Kleist made the incest phantasies of his childhood the
foundation of many poems. So for instance the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Marquise von O.</span>,
assaulted in a fainting fit, is protected from the foe pressing upon
her by some one who loves her and will subsequently surely marry
her. I need hardly explain that the evil one who will positively
force himself upon her is the father, from whom the son defends
the mother, that he may subsequently woo her. It is again only the
poet himself who sets himself as a youthful ideal god in place of
the aging father, as Jupiter descended from his throne renewed in
beauty and youth according to his divine power, to visit Alcmene
in the form of her spouse Amphitryon. In the &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zerbrochenen
Krug</span>&rdquo; (Broken Pitcher) the judge breaks violently into the room
of the beloved one&mdash;a typical symbol for one's own father who is
also in fact the child's first judge&mdash;and is driven out by the rightful
lover.</p>

<p>The objection need not be made that the poet has simply held to
his pattern. The choice of material betrays the purpose, which frequently
remains unconscious. What, we may say, impelled the poet
although he wished to translate it wholly, to take up Molière's
Amphitryon, one of his weakest productions too, and then change
it in so striking a fashion? Quite unlike the French version, Jupiter
becomes for Kleist the advocate with the wife-mother:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23.5em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;What I now feel for thee, Alcmene dearest,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ah, see! it soars far, far beyond the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which even a husband owes thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Depart, beloved, flee from this thy spouse,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And choose between us, either him or me.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I suffer with this shameful interchange,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The thought to me is all unbearable,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That this vain fellow's been received by thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whose cold heart thinks he holds a right o'er thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh! might I now to thee, my sweetest light,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A being of another sort appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy conqueror since the art to conquer thee<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Was taught me by the mighty gods.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In truth Kleist, like every other poet, chose the most of his material
in accordance with unconscious wishes, where beyond all else the
mother complex presses for poetic expression.</p>

<p>Let us apply once more that which has been so far discovered
to the &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Prinz von Homburg</span>.&rdquo; This is rendered yet more easy
from the fact that the electress is repeatedly designated by the hero
as &ldquo;Mother.&rdquo; His real mother had indeed at her death delivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104">104</a></span>him over to the friend of her youth with the words: &ldquo;Be a mother
to him when I am no longer here.&rdquo; And the electress had answered
in similar strain, &ldquo;He shall be mine as if my own in birth!&rdquo; But
since on the other hand Natalie also addresses her repeatedly as
Mother as she does the elector as Father, so Natalie is Kleist's beloved
sister in disguise. The poet would desire the laurel wreath
thus from his own sister. Why then the father's acquiescence? If
we now appeal to our psychoanalytic experience, this teaches us
that regularly the sister incest represents a later form of the older
and more serious mother incest. The boy, who first desires the
mother, satisfies himself later with the less forbidden and more
easily accessible sister. All poets follow very significantly this
psychoanalytically established relationship, as Rank<a name="FNanchor_31_32" href="#Footnote_31_32" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> has recently
convincingly shown. The poets often represent this, that the
phantasies and wishes are displaced from the mother to the sister
or they are split up between mother and sister, which then makes
their origin especially clear.</p>

<p>The latter is also the case with Kleist in the &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Prinz von Homburg</span>.&rdquo;
He takes for the mother he desires, at one time the electress,
at another time Natalie, &ldquo;his girl, his bride.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32_33" href="#Footnote_32_33" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It agrees
strikingly also that the prince in the fear of death expects to be
saved only by the electress, that is the mother, from the punishment
with which the elector father threatens him. So a child who knows
no way out for himself, no help any more, flees to his mother. Such
an unusual, shocking fear of death on the part of a field officer
needs explanation. It is nothing else than the child's fear in face of
the stern parent. It is further overdetermined in an infantile way.
In the drama the prince for a long time does not believe in the grim
seriousness of his position. The elector father will only put him to
the test. The sudden transition to frantic fear follows first when
the friend informs him that Natalie has sent back the addresses
carried by the ambassador, because she is betrothed to the latter.
This would have so roused the elector against him. From this time
on the prince&mdash;and the poet&mdash;holds everything as possible and is
ready to <ins title="sacrifiee">sacrifice</ins> even the hand of the beloved for his life.</p>

<p>A second determination likewise is not wanting, which is also
infantile. Freud has shown in the &ldquo;Interpretation of Dreams&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105">105</a></span>that the child does not at all connect the ideas of older people with
the words &ldquo;death&rdquo; and &ldquo;to die.&rdquo; He knows neither the terror nor
the shuddering fear of the eternal nothingness. To be dead means
to him merely to be away, gone away, no longer to be disturbed in his
wishes. For his slight experience has already taught him one thing,
dead people, as perhaps the grandparents, do not come back. From
this it is only a step that the child sometimes wishes death to his
father, when the latter disturbs him. Psychoanalysis tells us that
this is not perhaps a shocking exception but a matter of everyday
occurrence. Such thoughts are touched upon in the &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Prinz von
Homburg</span>.&rdquo; The false report has come that the elector father has
been shot and Natalie laments, &ldquo;Who will protect us from this
world of foes?&rdquo; Then is the prince ready on the spot to offer his
hand to the orphaned girl, also apparently to her mother. A child
wish comes to fulfilment, the setting aside of the father who interferes
with his plans for the mother. When the man believed to be
dead nevertheless returns, he pronounces, as we can understand,
the sentence of death upon his treacherous son. Only when the
latter had acknowledged the justice of the sentence&mdash;I might almost
<ins title="has">have</ins> said, after he had asked forgiveness, is he not only pardoned
but more than that recompensed, while now the father voluntarily
grants him his wish.</p>

<p>It seems to me significant that Kleist freely introduced into his
drama the complete condemnation to death as well as night wandering
and moon walking. In the first point he had turned tradition
quite to its opposite. In the original the great Friedrich relates that
on the triumphant battle field the elector has already forgiven the
prince that he had so lightly risked the welfare of the whole state:
&ldquo;If I had judged you according to the stern martial law, you would
have forfeited your life. But God forbid that I should sully the
brightness of this day by shedding the blood of a prince, who was
once the foremost instrument of my victory.&rdquo; Personal reasons,
and, as we know from psychoanalysis, these are always infantile
reasons, must have been involved when Kleist incorporated this
directly into his poetry and yet in so striking a fashion. Some of
these reasons I have been able to set forth above.</p>

<p>It is now clear that the apparently asexual desire for fame does
not lack its erotic foundation. The desire for fame is so greatly
exaggerated in Heinrich von Kleist that he will do no less than tear
the laurel from Goethe's forehead, because in his infantile attitude
he hopes through an unheard of poetic activity to supplant the father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106">106</a></span>with the mother. After the shipwreck of his masterpiece, the
Guiskard material, he longed for death because life had no more
value for him, but he finds later in the &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Prinz von Homburg</span>&rdquo; a
happier solution. For not only does the mother herself now crown
him but does it with the father's affectionate blessing. And the old
theme of night wandering and moon walking, that is climbing into
bed with the loved one, finds its place here although in an opposite
form and under a certain sexual repression. The child does not
come to the mother but she to him and places the longed for crown
upon his head even with the concurrence of the father. Also the
fact that the prince transgresses the elector's commands as the result
of his moon walking, to which the prince is subject, must somehow,
at least by analogy, have been created from the poet's own breast.
Nothing is said about this in regard to Kleist, of whose inner life we
know so little. Yet his very great interest in noctambulism and
similar &ldquo;night sides of the human soul,&rdquo; as well as his exceptional
understanding of the same, show that he at least must have possessed
a disposition toward it. It should be emphasized once more
in conclusion that the moon walking in the &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Prinz von Homburg</span>&rdquo;
does not lack the infantile sexual root, nor is the corresponding
erotic purpose wanting, which we have always found, heretofore, to
come to the loved one without being held responsible.</p>


<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap" lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Sündkind</span>,&rdquo; by Ludwig Anzengruber.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Sündkind</span>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Sin Child&rdquo;) by Anzengruber (in the
first volume of his &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dorfgänge</span>&rdquo;) tells of an apparently non-sexually
colored wandering by moonlight. There a 45-year-old pitch
worker, the mother of twelve children, who had all died except the
narrator, and for three years a widow, had become pregnant with a
&ldquo;sin child&rdquo; whose father no one would acknowledge himself. She
had always been a discreet woman, and was almost equal to her son
in her work, although he at thirty years old was at the height of
his manly strength. She had always been as exemplary in love as
in her work, a combination, as we know, not rare to find. Having
matured early she was with her first child at the age of fifteen and
when she was a widow &ldquo;the people could not wonder enough how
long it would be before she showed her age.&rdquo; Not rarely &ldquo;love&rdquo;
suddenly overcame her and even toward her grown son she could
occasionally make quite &ldquo;God forbidden&rdquo; eyes. One might almost
draw the conclusion from the following circumstance that he also
was more deeply dependent on the mother than he might acknowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107">107</a></span>to himself. Left alone with her during her confinement, he
was not able to look at her but drummed on the window pane and
became more and more confused although &ldquo;God knows, there was
no call for it.&rdquo; Then he turned around with his face burning red
and said, &ldquo;You ought to be ashamed, Mother, you ought to be
ashamed!&rdquo; Soon however not only remorse seized him but <ins title="be">he</ins>
began to curse at the folk, who see in the infant not his brother but
only the &ldquo;child of sin.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you think for a moment that I would
bear a grudge against the little innocent worm? Curse you, anyone
who would separate the children of one mother from each other!&rdquo;
After he had lost the love of his youth in earlier years, he had no
more interest in women but dwelt with his mother alone on the land
which belonged to the family. Later Martin toiled early and late
for the illegitimate child Poldl, as if he were its true father, for
whom moreover he never might make inquiry.</p>

<p>When Poldl was perhaps sixteen years old, his mother's health
began to fail and with her anxiety at approaching death she began
to be concerned for her soul, which she, according to human custom,
expressed as care for her illegitimate child. He should dedicate
himself to the Lord, should become a clergyman, by which he would
remain spotless. Martin, with keen insight, thought thus, &ldquo;That is
indeed the easiest way to get rid of one's own sin, to let some one
else atone for it&rdquo; and feared it might go hard with Poldl, hot
blooded by inheritance, but he had no effect upon the mother, who
was supported by the boy's guardian. Poldl also did not permit
himself simply to be talked of by her, but applied himself ever more
deeply to his future sacred calling, especially since all the people of
the place already paid court to him as if he were even now an ordained
clergyman. &ldquo;Soon he had no other thought than of his
future holy office and he might stay or go where he would, for
nothing was for him too good or too bad to remind him of it.&rdquo; &ldquo;He
strolled about one entire summer,&rdquo; Martin tells us, &ldquo;and did not
condescend to the least bit of work but when I was out with the
farm hands making hay in the meadows or reaping in the field, it
very often happened that he rushed unexpectedly out of the bushes
and began preaching to them. This seemed quite right to the lazy
folk, they would let their work lie and would stand gathered about
him and listen devoutly to him and I could not take ill their so excessive
piety. The mother thought as they did and found that his
absurd preaching there went straight to her heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We will stop here a moment. What drove Poldl so to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108">108</a></span>priestly calling, what made him so intent upon it? We might mention
in passing the vanity and the high sense of importance, which
is created by the desire in the sixteen year old boy after the most
reverend calling. Yet, though I would in no way undervalue his
ambition or the satisfaction of a so pleasantly tickled vanity, yet
decisive and determining these can scarcely be. Strong motives
must govern in order to explain more completely such an impulsion.
When Poldl strode over the fields and began to preach, &ldquo;At that
time the Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples&nbsp;&hellip;,&rdquo; then he was indeed
not far from conceiving himself as the Holy One and his mother as
the Virgin Mary. Jesus had offered himself for the sins of man, as
he now for the sin of his mother. According to this it is nothing
else than his love to the mother which drives him to the sacred
office, in which it is not to be forgotten that such a love, which leads
to a thought obsession, is in the light of experience never without
the erotic.</p>

<p>This mingling of sensuality and love to the mother, and to an
older woman who could be his mother, shows itself still more clearly
two years later, when he has a holiday from the seminary for a few
days. He finds at home a buxom picture of a woman, a relative on
a visit, almost twice as old as he, the very essence of cheeriness and
health. &ldquo;The boy clung closest to her. In spite of his eighteen
years he still seemed childish enough and this he turned to account,
and &lsquo;played the calf with her,&rsquo;&rdquo; to use the excellent word of the
writer.</p>

<p>Six years later Poldl was appointed to assist an invalid vicar,
in whose home a regular vicar's cook kept house with her sixteen
year old girl, whom she had from the old vicar. In the same year
Poldl's mother was laid to rest and her son appeared at her funeral,
where the robust peasant girls and maidens pressed themselves
upon him. But he &ldquo;withdrew shyly from every one of them and
gave his hand to no one, as he obligingly might have done. He has
always before this appeared like milk and blood,&rdquo; thought Martin,
the anxious one, &ldquo;now he has an unhealthy look, no color, sunken
cheeks, and his eyes are deep within, he stares at the ground and
cannot bear to have a stranger look at him. It does not please me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this is clear and transparent to the physician. In the young
man now twenty-four years old the inherited blood began to make
itself felt, and at the same time the cook and her daughter let no
stimulus be wanting. He suffered under his self restraint, grew
pale and hollow and because only his actions remained chaste but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109">109</a></span>not his thought, he could no more look freely upon a woman. When
he now preached in the pulpit, he spoke of the devil as the tempter
and of all his evil suggestions. He could declare what evil thoughts
come to a man and in closing he threatened his flock most earnestly
that the devil would carry them all away together. We know well
that no sins are more condemned than those which one holds himself
capable of committing or which one would himself most gladly
commit if only one dared.</p>

<p>The young priest owed it to a great love which he felt for the
miller's daughter that he kept himself pure at least in body. So
much the more was the vicar's cook intent upon bringing about his
downfall through her girl. Then they could again rule at the
vicarage, since the old vicar's days were numbered, when Poldl
came into the fat living left vacant. It was at the burial of the old
priest that Poldl delivered at the grave the funeral oration for the
dead, and endeavored to lay the good example which the old man had
given upon the hearts of his flock. As he lifted his eyes once and
caught those of the miller's Marie-Liese, who was listening so devoutly,
not taking her eyes from him, he suddenly remained stuck
in the midst of his speech and could find his place in the text again
only with difficulty. Was he not able to maintain before her pure
glance the fiction of a noble priest, did it come to his consciousness
that he was wandering in the same paths on which the other had
been most severely wounded? Something of this the miller's
daughter seems to have had in mind, for as she later begged his
pardon for having confused him by staring at him, at the same time
she advised him not to have anything to do with those at the vicarage.
The vicar's daughter, who had stolen up unobserved, shook
her fist at them both, while her mother drew Poldl later into a
corner to give vent to her feelings, &ldquo;You cannot have the miller's
daughter and do not for a moment believe that she would be willing
to have you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On his death bed in the lesser parish, which he held later, he
complained to Martin, &ldquo;I should never have been a priest&rdquo;&mdash;with
his inherited passionate blood, in spite of his mother's urging and
his love to her. &ldquo;Martin, you have no idea how hard it is to run
caught in a sack; it costs a deal of trouble to keep oneself upright.
If one does not twist about one falls into it. The cowl was
such a sack for me.&hellip; Brother, I have unwittingly fallen into
disgrace as a wild beast into a trap, and I am more ashamed of it
perhaps than the worst sinner of that which he has done deliberately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110">110</a></span>and maliciously. I would not have stayed in the trap, could everything
at first only have remained secret, so that no one would have
been afraid to extend a clean hand to me, by which I might have
found myself and might again belong to the world and everything.
But that the others knew right well and they wanted me for themselves
and therefore they have behaved without fear or shame so
that soon everything was free and open to all Rodenstein from the
forest house at one end to the mill at the other. From that time on
I have seen no friendly eye, and the blue, yes, the blue eyes (of the
miller's daughter) were always turned defiantly away from me.
And because she was unkind to me she became all at once kind to
some one whom she formerly could not bear. The folk shook their
heads and prophesied little good for her. So the time came when I
must come here to this parish. There lay upon me what can soon
crush one to the ground, for peace and honor were squandered and
those who had won them from me hung like chains upon me and
the bit of sunshine that I had had in life I had to leave behind in
Rodenstein. When however there was added to this concern for her
to whom I owed the bit of happiness, I broke under it and then they
took me and brought me here and I let myself be brought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So had he truly become a child of sin with the feeling of lost
purity and a great consciousness of guilt upon his soul. And that
he had not merely squandered his own honor and peace but had also
dragged the beloved to harm, so that she must have doubts of her
purity, this does the rest for him and makes him the willing play
ball of the parish folk. From the first day when he took over his
new charge, he began to wander in the full moonlight up to the
ghostly hour of midnight. At the stroke of twelve he went to the
pulpit, over which a bright moonbeam lay, which also lighted up his
face as bright as day. With closed eyes he knelt in the pulpit, &ldquo;his
folded hands before him on the upholstered border, the head bowed
upon it as if in quiet prayer to collect himself as usual before the
sermon. All at once he raised himself, bent forward a little as if
the pews were full of people and he wished first to look them over,
then he threw his arms to either side and stood there like one who
would say, &lsquo;Strike me dead, if I have offended you, but I cannot
do otherwise!&rsquo; He did not say this but in a voice as of one speaking
in a dream he uttered the words, &lsquo;I know of nothing!&rsquo; And
then once more&mdash;his hands extended toward heaven and spread
open, as if he would show everything to all within or about the
church&mdash;&lsquo;I know of nothing!&rsquo; Afterward he turned and went.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111">111</a></span>In this classic picture of the brother are some features of a new
sort. Above all, sexuality appears only incidentally to play a part,
in so far as it awakens the latent tendency to moon walking. Poldl
begins to wander at midnight after the miller's daughter is lost to
him and he is tortured by anxiety for her future. Otherwise he
does what so frequently is done by the moon walker, he carries out
the apparently harmless activity of the day as he prays in the church
before an imaginary audience. At least he truly imitates the formalities
with which prayer begins, though the conclusion does not
accord with the beginning. It sounds like a justification before the
folk of Rodenstein, who have taken offence at his action, that
he stands there in Luther's place as one who cannot do otherwise
though one strike him dead. At the same time the repeated
outcry at the end, &ldquo;I know of nothing, I know of nothing!&rdquo; smacks
not only of a denial that he did not know perhaps why Marie had
fallen into distress, but suggests the directly infantile. Thus a child
insists, when it is reproached, that it has done nothing.</p>

<p>Let us take up again the threads of our narrative. Poldl faded
day by day under the pressure of his heavy burden of soul. At last
there remained nothing else for him but to let them write to his
brother that he lay sick and wished to see him. As Martin entered
the sickroom Poldl stretched his lean arms toward him, breathed a
heartfelt cry and began to weep aloud like a child. &ldquo;You are like
a father to me, Martin, you are like a father to me!&rdquo; And from
time to time he added, &ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; Then he stroked Martin's
rough hands, &ldquo;the hands which had toiled for his daily bread when
he was a boy.&rdquo; And now he poured forth his confession. He
should not have become a priest, then the people of the parish
would have remained strangers to him and he perhaps would have
succeeded to the Rodenstein mill. His entire concern centered itself
about this, that he had not only lost Marie-Liese but was also to
blame for the overthrow of her happiness. He related to his brother
how the parish folk had apprehended him, so that he was covered
with shame, how they all hung about the great bell of Rodenstein
until finally the miller's daughter turned from him and to another.
After the confession was made Poldl fell asleep contentedly, yet
only to wander that very midnight. The invalid was very ill, when
Martin talked with him again the next day. And suddenly he
began to speak of the days of his childhood and it was remarkable
to the brother &ldquo;how he had remembered the most trivial thing in
regard to it and it seemed to me as if he himself often wondered at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112">112</a></span>it in the midst of his speech. Bit by bit thus he took up his life and
we talked together of the time when he ran about the sitting-room
and the court in his little child's frock, until the time when he went
to school, to the seminary, to Rodenstein.&hellip; The sun had set
when with our prattle we had come to the place where we were, at
Weissenhofen. &lsquo;That's the end,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and there remains nothing
else to tell.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said my brother reflectively, &lsquo;that's
the <ins title="end,&rsquo;">end,</ins> and there remains nothing more to <ins title="tell.&rdquo;">tell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</ins> Soon he noticed
how truly Martin had spoken in every respect, for the end had come
for him now physically. With a blessing on his lips for the newly
won brother of his heart, he laid himself down to sleep. &ldquo;It had
become still as a mouse in the room. After perhaps a quarter of
an hour I heard him say, &lsquo;Yes, yes, were we now together, only
you must not hold me so tightly to your breast.&rsquo; With this he threw
himself suddenly over to the right, drew a deep breath, and it was
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let us consider once more the circumstances of the moon walking
which accompanied this. He begins with this after his removal
from Rodenstein and from his heart's beloved. There had preceded
the grief over his wasted honor and his forfeited peace, the pain at
the loss of the miller's daughter and, which is rather conclusive, the
torturing regard for her future, which completely paralyzed his will
power. The latter point is somewhat remarkable. For at bottom it
was never said that her marriage was unhappy. The people had
shaken their heads before it, only, and prophesied nothing good.
When Martin fourteen years after the death of his brother meets
Marie-Liese at his grave, she has become a handsome woman and
has been a widow for eight years but is well poised mentally and
lives for her boy. In Poldl's concern the wish must indeed have
been father of the thought. If he could not have his treasure, then
she should not be happy at the side of another man. Yet apparently
this does not refer alone to the miller's daughter. Psychoanalytic
experience teaches that where the reaction manifests itself all too
strongly this happens because it is not merely a reaction to a present,
but above all to a long past experience, which stands behind the
other and offers first the original actual tonal background. Only
apparently is the effect too strong, if we measure it merely by the
actual cause, in truth however the action corresponds to all the
causes, that is the new added to the old.</p>

<p>We can say further, if we apply this experience to the poet's
narrative, Poldl had not merely lost the miller's daughter forever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113">113</a></span>by entangling himself with the vicar's daughter, but far more another,
the one for whom he had entered orders. The mother had
said to Martin, &ldquo;There is only one way, one single way by which
my boy can be saved from ruin and I can obtain peace and forgiveness
from my sin.&rdquo; This task, to atone for the mother by a holy
life, had not prevented him from a passionate love for Marie-Liese
or from an intrigue with the pastor's daughter, yet, since
he had on the latter's account lost his purity, something else was
also laid waste thereby, that which had given peace to him and
a purpose to his muddled life, the love for his mother. As he tarried
already half in the other world, his last words were, &ldquo;Yes, yes,
were we now together, only you must not hold me so tightly to your
breast.&rdquo; This had the mother in her tenderness done to her little
boy. We see here the regression to the infantile, to a primitive child
libido.</p>

<p>The matter can be followed still further. The walking by
moonlight itself did not begin, in spite of every predisposing cause,
until Poldl was connected with the new parish and no longer shared
the same locality with his beloved. It is not revealed whether the
pulpit of the Weissenhofen church looked perhaps in the direction
of Rodenstein or not. It seems to me significant that the pastor's
daughter crept after Poldl all night long, not perhaps merely the
first time, as if she suspected his hidden erotic or feared even that
he might go out toward Rodenstein. He must also every midnight
establish the fact that, in spite of his sins of the flesh, he considered
himself still worthy to be a priest. For the same reason he himself
read the mass every day until near the end. Indeed he read this not
merely in the daytime but also at midnight when other priests sought
rest. And by his behavior in sleep walking it was as if he wished
each time anew to justify himself before his Rodenstein parish, and
especially before his beloved. The Luther attitude referred to the
former, &ldquo;Though you slay me, I cannot do otherwise!&rdquo; the outspoken
infantile expression, the only words which he actually
speaks, &ldquo;I know of nothing!&rdquo; is for the latter. Thus a small boy
protests his innocence when any one faces him with a misdeed. It
was as if he wanted to go back to his beloved, to Marie-Liese, as if
to his own mother.</p>

<p>Again we find libidinous and infantile causes as the starting
point of moonlight walking and sleep walking. Only the erotic no
longer appears so openly as with the other poets but receives a certain
disguise. Yet brother Martin, the philosopher of life, recognizes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114">114</a></span>clearly the kernel of the matter: &ldquo;So I had also to witness the
end with him, as with so many of my brothers and sisters. But I
still think today this need not have happened, if the mother had
permitted him his life as it would have been lived out freely by
himself. First she should not have counted it so great as sin, for
otherwise there would have been no pitch worker Poldl in the
world. Although she thought of it within herself that it was a sin,
she should have so looked upon it that she could have settled it
with the Lord God. Ah yes! he had to go about in the cowl, which
had become a greater sack than a farmer's jumper and there all the
sins of others enter, but if no one shall commit one in his own right,
how would one find shelter for all these? If I had only at
that time been obstinate about the planning of this thing, I would
have foreseen the wrong of it and have known that the mother was
an old woman, and with many conscience grows when reason is
going to sleep. Faith, honor and peace he would never have squandered,
for the farmer's position does not play with so high a stake.
Still today the little fellow runs gaily about the yard under my eyes.&hellip;
Ah, you poor sin child, how wantonly was the joy of living
destroyed for you!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Macbeth</span>,&rdquo; by Shakespeare.</h3>

<p>As I now undertake the analysis of the case of Lady Macbeth, I
stand not only before the last but the most difficult portion of my
work. Here indeed everything sexual and the erotic itself seem to
be quite excluded; and my attempt appears to fail in both directions,
in the sexual as well as in the infantile, to apply to Shakespeare's
heroine what my psychoanalytically treated cases, as well as all those
others from literature have furnished. The poet has devoted no
more than one single scene to this entire sleep walking including
the grounds for it, and he has said as little of Lady Macbeth's
childhood as of her sexual erotic life. Our knowledge of Shakespeare's
life is above all so meager, if we turn from the case to the
poet himself, that the difficulties tower in our way almost mountain
high. The reader will in this case, which presents itself so unfavorably,
have to expect neither that certainty nor even that high
degree of probability of results, which the earlier examples gave
us. Here through no fault of mine all aids to interpretation are
wanting. I should consider it as something accomplished if the
reader did not say at the close, &ldquo;The case of Lady Macbeth contradicts
all that has been heretofore discovered,&rdquo; as it will appear at
first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115">115</a></span>
We will begin with the literary source for Macbeth, Holinshed's
&ldquo;History of Scotland.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_33_34" href="#Footnote_33_34" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Shakespeare confined himself so closely
to this that he took over accurately, even to the dialogue, whole
scenes into his tragedy. The deviations are for this reason so much
the more interesting. In the chronicle Macbeth is simply the
tyrant. At the very beginning it is said of him, &ldquo;he would certainly
have been held as the most worthy of rulers, if his nature
had not had so strong a tendency to cruelty.&rdquo; His cruelty is frequently
emphasized, both at the bier of the dead Macdowald and
toward the dwellers in the western isles, who &ldquo;called him a bloodthirsty
tyrant and the cruel murderer of those to whom the king's
grace had granted their lives.&rdquo; Finally also in the camp of the
Danes when they were overcome &ldquo;he wrought such havoc upon all
sides without the least resistance that it was terrible to look upon.&rdquo;
A change seems however to have taken place in his character when,
after the murder of Duncan, he had seized the kingdom for himself.
&ldquo;He began to reform the laws and to root out all the irregularities
and abuses in the administration.&rdquo; He freed the land for
many years from all robbers, guarded most carefully the church and
clergy, and, to put it briefly, was looked upon as the defender and
shield of everything blameless. He established also many good
laws and ruled the kingdom for ten years with the greatest wisdom
and justice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This apparent equity and zeal for all that is best was however
merely hypocrisy; he wished only to win the favor of the people.
Tyrants are always distrustful, they are always afraid that others
will rob them of their power by the same unrighteous means by
which they themselves have succeeded. As soon as Macbeth discovered
any plans against himself, he no longer concealed his intentions
but practised and permitted every kind of cruelty.&rdquo; At first
the words of the three sisters of fate lay always in his thoughts. In
order to attain to what they had prophesied he was willing to have
Banquo and his son murdered. Yet the murderers hired for the
purpose killed only the former while Fleance succeeded in escaping.
&ldquo;Luck seems to have deserted Macbeth after the murder of
Banquo. None of his undertakings were successful, every one
feared for his life and scarcely dared appear before the king. He
feared every one and every one feared him, so that he was always
seeking opportunity for the execution of suspected persons. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116">116</a></span>distrust and his cruelty increased day by day, his bloodthirstiness
was not to be appeased.&hellip; He gave himself over recklessly to
his natural ferocity, oppressed his subjects even to the poorest and
permitted himself every shameful deed.&rdquo; Shakespeare has represented
the rest fairly truly according to Holinshed, only that in
actuality this lasted for seven years, until Macbeth fell at the hands
of Macduff.</p>

<p>It is also worthy of note what Holinshed has made the ground
of the murder of Duncan. There preceded in the chronicle the
promise of the three witches, further Malcolm's appointment as
prince of Cumberland and, as a result of this, succession to the
kingdom. Now Malcolm could &ldquo;ascend the throne directly after
his father's death, while in the old laws it was provided that the
nearest relative would be placed upon the throne, if, at the death of
his predecessor, the prince who was called to the succession was
not yet capable of ruling.&rdquo; This latter had happened to Macbeth,
Duncan's cousin. &ldquo;Then began Macbeth, from whom by this arrangement
of the king all hope of the throne was taken, to consider
the means whereby he could seize the crown by force for himself.
For he believed that Duncan had done him a great wrong, when he
named his infant son as successor to his throne and had so annulled
all other claims. Moreover the words of the witches encouraged
him to his purpose. But foremost of all his wife, a proud and
haughty woman, who longed with most burning desire after the
name of queen, would not desist until she had strengthened him to
the uttermost in his intention.&rdquo; This last sentence is the chronicler's
only notice of Lady Macbeth.</p>

<p>We can now measure what Shakespeare has contributed himself
to her character as well as to that of her husband. At first the
absolute cruelty, which with Holinshed was the chief trait of his
character, is wanting in Macbeth, and therefore ambition is mentioned
first. Macbeth becomes the tyrant wading in blood first after
the murder of Duncan and then more from a necessity to defend
himself. His own wife characterizes best the earlier hero:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Yet Macbeth at bottom dared not murder the king, he only toyed
with the thought. He must be instigated from without, if the deed
is not to be put off until the Greek calends. Lady Macbeth from
the very beginning feels it her task to strengthen her laggard and
doubting husband in his ambition. This Shakespeare had already
found in Holinshed. As the chronicle has pictured it: &ldquo;Still more
did his wife urge him on to attack the king, for she was exorbitantly
ambitious and burned with an inextinguishable desire to bear the
name of queen.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_34_35" href="#Footnote_34_35" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> While she thus incited her husband, she fulfilled
yet more the longing of her own heart:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21.5em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">&ldquo;Hie thee hither,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">She summons herself also to the task, calls the evil spirits of the air
to her aid and will become a man, since her husband is no man:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>When Macbeth announces, &ldquo;Duncan comes here to-night,&rdquo; she
asks sinisterly, &ldquo;And when goes hence?&rdquo;&mdash;Macbeth: &ldquo;To-morrow&mdash;as
he purposes.&rdquo;&mdash;Lady Macbeth:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118">118</a></span>It may be seen that the really cruel one is here first Lady Macbeth
and not her husband. He on the contrary must always torture
himself with scruples and doubts. He constantly holds before himself
the outward results of his deed, brings everything together
which should protect Duncan from his dagger and can only say in
regard to the opposite course:</p>

<p class="no-indent">And he explains to his wife, &ldquo;We will proceed no further in this
business.&rdquo; Then must Lady Macbeth rebuke him as a coward, no
longer trust his love, if he, when time and place so wait upon him,
retract from his purpose. She lays on the strongest accent, yes, uses
the &ldquo;word of fury&rdquo;:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and finally develops the entire plan and promises her assistance,
before she can persuade her husband to the murder.</p>

<p>She has stupefied the two chamberlains, upon whom the guilt

<p class="no-indent">Then her husband appears with the daggers. As he looks at his
bloody hands a cry is wrung from him, &ldquo;This is a sorry sight.&rdquo;
Yet the Lady repulses him harshly, &ldquo;A foolish thought, to say a

</div>

<p>But the horrid deed has not brought the expected good fortune.
After Duncan's murder Macbeth finds no rest and no sleep: &ldquo;To
be thus, is nothing; But to be safely thus.&rdquo; So he first considers
removing Banquo and his son. But Lady Macbeth is little content:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&ldquo;Nought's had, all's spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where our desire is got without content;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis safer to be that which we destroy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than, by destruction, dwell in doubtful joy.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Then comes her husband. All night he has been so shaken with
terrible dreams that he would rather be in Duncan's place, &ldquo;Than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120">120</a></span>on the torture of the mind to lie, In restless ecstasy.&rdquo; Lady Macbeth
tries here to comfort him with the only tender impulse in the
drama:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 24em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">&ldquo;Come on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be bright and jovial 'mong your guests to-night.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_35_36" href="#Footnote_35_36" class="fnanchor">[35]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Macbeth promises to do as she asks and charges her to treat Banquo
especially with distinction. Nor does he conceal from her what
now tortures him most, &ldquo;Dear wife, Thou knowest that Banquo,
and his Fleance, lives.&rdquo; And immediately the Lady is her old self:
&ldquo;But in them nature's copy's not eterne.&rdquo; Though Lady Macbeth
is represented as at once prepared for a second murder, Macbeth
has now no more need of her: &ldquo;Be innocent of the knowledge,
dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, although he shrinks back no longer from any sort of evil
deed, he does so before the horrible pictures of his phantasies, the
hallucinations of his unconscious. Here is where Shakespeare's
genius enters. The Macbeth of the Chronicle commits throughout
all his acts of horror apparently in cold blood. At least nothing to
the contrary is reported. With Shakespeare on the other hand
Macbeth, who is represented in the beginning as more ambitious
than cruel, is pathologically tainted. From his youth on he suffered
from frequent visions, which, for example, caused him to see
before Duncan's murder an imaginary dagger. This &ldquo;strange infirmity,
which is nothing To those that know me,&rdquo; comes to light
most vividly on the appearance of Banquo's ghost at the banquet.
Lady Macbeth must use all her presence of mind to save at least the
outward appearance. With friendly exhortation, yet with grim
reproof and scornful word, she attempts to bring her husband to
himself. In this last scene, when she interposes in Macbeth's behavior,
she stands completely at the height. Not until the guests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121">121</a></span>have departed does she grow slack in her replies. In truth neither
her husband's resolution to wade on in blood nor his word that
strange things haunt his brain can draw from her more than the
response, &ldquo;You lack the season of all natures, sleep.&rdquo; It seems as
if she had collapsed exhausted after her tremendous psychical effort.</p>

<p>Shakespeare has in strange fashion told us nothing of what
goes on further in her soul, though he overmotivates everything
else, even devotes whole scenes to this one purpose. We first see
her again in the last act in the famous sleep walking scene. She
begins to walk in her sleep, falls ill with it one might well say, just
on that day when Macbeth goes to war. Her lady in waiting saw
her from this day on, at night, &ldquo;rise from her bed, throw her nightgown
upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write
upon it, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all
this while in a most fast sleep.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A great perturbation in nature!
to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching,&rdquo;
the evidently keen sighted physician thinks. He soon has the
opportunity to observe the Lady's sleep walking for himself. She
comes, in her hand a lighted candle, which at her express command
must be always burning near her bed. Her eyes are open as she
walks, but their sense is shut. Then she rubs her hands together
as if to wash them, which she does according to the statement of
the lady in waiting, often continuously for a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Now they hear her speaking: &ldquo;Yet here's a spot. Out damned
spot! out, I say!&mdash;One, two, why, then 'tis time to do't.&mdash;Hell is
murky!&mdash;Fie, my lord! a soldier, and afear'd? What need we fear
who knows it, when none can call our power to account?&mdash;Yet who
would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?&mdash;The
Thane of Fife had a wife; Where is she now?&mdash;What, will
these hands ne'er be clean?&mdash;No more o' that, my lord, no more o'
that; you mar all with this starting.&mdash;Here's the smell of the blood
still; all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
Oh! oh! oh!&mdash;Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not
so pale;&mdash;I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out
of his grave.&mdash;To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate. Come,
come, come, come, give me your hand. What's done cannot be undone.
To bed, to bed, to bed.&rdquo; After such appearances she always
in fact goes promptly to bed. The physician who observes
her pronounces his opinion: &ldquo;This disease is beyond my practice.
Yet have I known those which have walked in their sleep, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122">122</a></span>have died holily in their beds.&rdquo; Here however there seems to be
something different:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Foul whisperings are abroad; unnatural deeds<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Do breed unnatural troubles.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And then as if he were a psychoanalyst:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22.5em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">&ldquo;Infected minds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">God, God forgive us all! Look after her;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remove from her the means of all annoyance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still keep eyes upon her.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Also he answers Macbeth, who inquires after the condition of the
patient.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21.5em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">&ldquo;Not so sick, my lord,<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="spaced">. . . . . . </span>Therein the patient<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must minister to himself.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Yet as the king's star declines neither the doctor's foresight nor his
skill prevents Lady Macbeth, the &ldquo;diabolical queen&rdquo; from laying
hands upon herself.</p>

<p>This case of sleep walking, if we consider it, seems first to correspond
entirely to the popular view, that the wanderer carries over
to the nighttime the activities of the day, or to speak more correctly,
of the most important day of the last month. We saw in the
first act how she reproaches Macbeth for his cowardice, encourages
him and controls his actions. Only in two points, very significant
ones to be sure, does it appear that she has now taken over her husband's
rôle upon herself; in the disturbance of her sleep and the
concern for the blood upon her hands. How had she rebuffed Macbeth
when he had called out in regard to his bloody hands, &ldquo;This
is a sorry <ins title="sight&rdquo;!">sight!&rdquo;</ins> It was only a foolish thought. &ldquo;Go get some
water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand.&rdquo; But Macbeth
was not to be shaken, the entire ocean would not suffice.
Rather would the king's blood, which he had shed, change its green
to glowing red. Yet when Lady Macbeth completes his work for
him, she remarks lightly, &ldquo;My hands are of your color; but I shame
To wear a heart so white.&hellip; A little water clears us of this deed.&rdquo;
In her sleep walking itself she encourages her husband, &ldquo;Wash
your hands, put on your nightgown.&rdquo; She seeks however in vain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123">123</a></span>in this very sleep walking to wipe the stains from her hands, they
smell always of blood and not all the perfumes of Arabia will
sweeten her hands. Must not the inner meaning of all her sleep
walking lie exactly in these two points, in which she has so completely
turned about?</p>

<p>It must be observed that in the tragedy as in the previously related
tale of the &ldquo;Sin Child&rdquo; the sleep walking does not begin in
childhood nor in puberty, but in both instances in somewhat more
mature years, and, what is significant, as an illness, more precisely
a psychic illness. The sin child fell ill because he had lost his pure
beloved one, who had taken the place of his mother, the original
love object of his earliest childhood; and Lady Macbeth, who had
herself become queen through a murder, falls ill just at that moment
when her lord must go to the battlefield to defend his life and his
crown. For not without reason the fate of Macduff's wife, who
was slain when her husband had gone from her, occurs to her also
when she, while wandering, speaks of the much blood which Duncan
had. Therefore it seems likely, and is in fact generally believed,
that Lady Macbeth becomes ill because of her anxiety for
life and kingdom. Only the facts do not strictly agree with this.
In the first place her husband's campaign is by no means unpromising.
On the contrary he has heard from the witches that his end
would be bound with apparently unfulfillable conditions, so unfulfillable
that the prophecy at once frees him from all fear.</p>

<p>Having hidden nothing from the &ldquo;partner of his greatness&rdquo; he
would scarcely conceal the promise of the witches, which increased
his confidence to the uttermost. Besides it cannot be fear and
anxiety which brings on her night wandering. Another current
explanation also seems to me to have little ground. As Brandes has
recently interpreted it, &ldquo;The sleep walking scene shows in the most
remarkable fashion how the pricking of an evil conscience, when it
is dulled by day, is more keen at night and robs the guilty one of
sleep and health.&rdquo; Now severe pangs of conscience may well disturb
sleep, but they would hardly create sleep walking. Criminals
are hardly noctambulists. Macbeth himself is an example how far
stings of conscience and remorse can lead a sensitive man. He has
no more rest after he has murdered the king and Banquo, yet he
does not become a sleep walker. There must be another cause here
which precipitates Lady Macbeth's sleep walking.</p>

<p>We will first examine the relation of husband and wife to one
another in order to trace out this mystery. The character of Lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124">124</a></span>Macbeth has caused many a one in Germany to rack his brains
since the time of Tieck. Up till that time she passed simply as
Megaera, as an &ldquo;arch witch,&rdquo; as Goethe calls her. This opinion
prevailed not only in Germany but in the English motherland too.
But this view went against the grain with the German spirit.
Therefore Ludwig Tieck first looked upon Lady Macbeth as a
tender, loving wife. From this time on there arose critics and even
poets, who in the same way wished to wash her clean. I will cite
the two most important, Friedrich Theodor Vischer and Rudolf
Hans Bartsch. The former, of whom I explained earlier, that he
did not hesitate to make an interpolation to prove his point, sums
up his judgment in the following sentences: &ldquo;It is not ambition
alone that moves her, but love which would see her lord become
great&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;78). And in a second place, &ldquo;She loved her husband
and had sacrificed her conscience more for him than for herself&rdquo;
(p.&nbsp;124). R.&nbsp;H. Bartsch goes much further in his romance, &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Elisabeth
Kött</span>.&rdquo; Wigram says to the heroine, &ldquo;Do you not feel how
she (Lady Macbeth) before everything that she says cannot hitch
horses enough to carry her slow and immovable lord along?&rdquo; In
the sleep walking scene &ldquo;the utter crushing of this poor, overburdened
heart burst forth in the torture of the dream wandering.&rdquo; At
the close he pronounces his opinion: &ldquo;If there is a poor weak woman
upon earth, so it is this arch enchantress, who loves her husband
so much that she has in admirable fashion studied all his faults and
weaknesses that she may cover over the deficiencies with her
trembling body. Seek the wife in her rôle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What truth is there in these viewpoints? The poet himself has
been dead for three hundred years and has left behind him not a
syllable concerning Lady Macbeth except in the text of the tragedy.
Therefore according to my opinion nothing remains but to keep to
this. At the most we can draw upon Holinshed's chronicle, which
Shakespeare so frequently followed literally. According to this
Lady Macbeth was extravagantly ambitious and when she continually
urged Macbeth to murder Duncan, this was only because
she &ldquo;burned with an unquenchable desire to bear the name of
queen.&rdquo; There is never a syllable of a feeling of love for her husband,
or that she desired the crown only for his sake. This objection
might be made here, that as Shakespeare has often gone beyond
his source, as in creating the sleep walking scene without a model
for it, so he might just as well have given characters to Lady Macbeth
of which the source said nothing. Certainly that would be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125">125</a></span>priori conceivable. Only that must appear clearly from the text
of the tragedy. Yet what does this say? Carefully as I have read
its lines, I have not been able to find a single, actual uninterpolated
word of love from Lady Macbeth. That is of double significance
from the poet of &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rdquo; He who could give such
language to love would not have completely denied it in &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo;
if Lady Macbeth was to have been a loving wife. One can
find everything in her words, warning, entreaty and adjuration, upbraidings
and threatenings, anger, yes, almost abuse, yet not one
natural note of love.</p>

<p>This has a so much harsher effect since her husband approaches
her usually as an actual lover, or more accurately stated up to the
murder of Banquo. She is warm only where it concerns the attainment
of her goal; it is her ambition which demands satisfaction.
She is always to her husband &ldquo;my dearest partner of my greatness&rdquo;
as he once appropriately writes her. It is not to be considered that
Shakespeare, who always overmotivates his situations, should have
at the height of his power so obscured from recognition all the love
impulses, which would have seemed to be decisive for her whole
character. The truth is simply that Lady Macbeth is no loving wife,
but merely greedy of fame, as already represented in the Chronicle.
I suspect that the authors who all the way through see in her the
loving spouse are expressing their own complexes, their own unconscious
wishes. Such an one as Bartsch for example cannot think
otherwise of a woman than as unfolding lovingly to the man.</p>

<p>Lady Macbeth makes upon me, in her relation toward her frequently
wooing husband as it were, the impression of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">natura
frigida</i>, that is a sexually cold woman. If one takes her own frightful
word for it, that she could tear the breast from her own sucking
child and dash its brains out, then the mother love seems never to
have been strong within her, but rather whatever feeling she has
possessed has been changed to passionate ambition. Now psychoanalytic
experience teaches that when a woman remains sexually
cold toward a sympathetic and potent man, this goes back to an
early sealing up of affect with a forbidden, because an incest object.
Such women have almost always from their tenderest infancy on
loved father or brother above all and never through all their lives
freed themselves from this early loved object. Though at puberty
compelled to cut them off as sexual objects, yet they have held fast
to them in the unconscious and become incapable of transferring to
another man. It is possible also in the case of Lady Macbeth to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126">126</a></span>think of such an indissoluble bond. Moreover certain features in the
sleep walking scene seem to speak directly of a repressed sexual life.</p>

<p>Lady Macbeth wanders at night, since her husband has left her
and marital intercourse has been broken off.<a name="FNanchor_36_37" href="#Footnote_36_37" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In her hand is
a lighted candle, which according to her express command must
burn near her bed, and only now for the first time, otherwise the
lady in waiting would not have laid such stress upon the fact. The
candle in her hand, that is a feature which up till now we have met
in none of our cases, but which, as a glance into literature teaches
me, is by no means infrequently found with sleep walkers. It
can hardly be considered a mere accident that Shakespeare discovered
just this characteristic, which is really atypical. One would
be much more inclined to suspect in it a secret, hidden meaning.
Then at once a connection forces itself. We know from the infantile
history of so many people that a tenderly solicitous parent,
the father or the mother, likes to convince himself or herself, with
a candle in the hand, that the child is asleep.<a name="FNanchor_37_38" href="#Footnote_37_38" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Then we would
have on one side a motive for sleep walking in general, that one is
playing the part of the loving parent, as on the other hand a motive
for the lighted candle. The latter has however a symbolic sexual
sense which is quite typical and is repeatedly and regularly found.
The burning candle always stands for one thing and signifies in
dreams as in fairy tales, folklore, and sagas without exception the
same thing, an erect phallus. Now it becomes clear why Lady Macbeth,
after her husband had gone to the war, has a lighted candle
always burning near her bed, and why then she wanders around like
a ghost with it at night.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the words she utters during her sleep walking
contains a second unmistakably sexual relationship. Here she repeats
not less than five times the demand upon her husband, &ldquo;To
bed,&rdquo; while in the corresponding murder scene (II, 2) it simply
reads, &ldquo;Retire we to our chamber; A little water clears us of this
deed.&rdquo; The further repetition, &ldquo;Come, come, come, come, give me
your hand,&rdquo; sounds again infantile through and through. So one
speaks to a child, scarcely to an adult. It seems as if she takes the
father or the mother by the hand and bids them go to bed. One
recognizes already in this passage that this atypical sleep walking of
Lady Macbeth also leads naturally into the sexual and the infantile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127">127</a></span>
It will not be difficult to determine now toward whom the repressed,
because strongly forbidden, sexual wishes of Lady Macbeth
are directed. Who else could it be but her own father, the
original love object of every little girl; what other person of her
childhood, who later becomes an unsuitable sexual object, but yet
hinders for all the future the transference of love over to the husband?
This is the one who summons her to walk in her sleep, the
lighted candle in her hand. It is quite an everyday experience,
which holds for everyone, for the well as for every one who later
becomes ill, that in reality the first love, which bears quite clearly
features of sense pleasure, belongs to the earliest years of childhood,
and that its objects are none other than the child's own parents
and in the second place the brothers and sisters. Here the polar
attraction of the sexes holds in the relation of the elder to the
younger and vice versa, that is the attraction of the man to the
woman and the woman to the man. It is &ldquo;a natural tendency,&rdquo;
says Freud<a name="FNanchor_38_39" href="#Footnote_38_39" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> in the &ldquo;Interpretation of Dreams,&rdquo; &ldquo;for the father to
indulge the little daughter, and for the mother to take the part of
the sons, while both work earnestly for the education of the little
ones when the magic of sex does not prejudice their judgment. The
child is very well aware of any partiality, and resists that member
of the parental couple who discourages it.&hellip; Thus the child obeys
its own sexual impulse, and at the same time reinforces the feeling
which proceeds from the parents, if it makes a selection among the
parents that corresponds to theirs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We will stop here at two factors which will occupy us again later,
the being in love with the parent of the opposite sex, and then the
resistance against the one of the same sex. Corresponding to the
love, every child in the period of innocence wants to &ldquo;marry&rdquo; the
former. I recall what a colleague told me of a dialogue between
him and his little five year old daughter. She began, &ldquo;I want to
get married.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;To you, Papa.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I already have
a wife.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Then you would have two wives.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That won't do.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Very
well, then I will choose a man who is as nice as you.&rdquo; And
Freud relates (p.&nbsp;219), &ldquo;An eight year old girl of my acquaintance,
when her mother is called from the table, takes advantage of the opportunity
to proclaim herself her successor. &lsquo;Now I shall be
Mamma; Charles, do you want some more vegetables? Have some,
I beg you,&rsquo; and so on. A particularly gifted and vivacious girl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128">128</a></span>not yet four years old, &hellip; says outright: &lsquo;Now mother can go
away; then father must marry me and I shall be his wife.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>We will add just one more little experience to give us a broader
point of view. The interpretation of dreams, fairy tales and myths
teaches us regularly that the phantasies of the child, like those of
all peoples in their period, identify father with king or emperor.
Naturally then the father's wife becomes the queen. This fact of
experience, which is always to be substantiated, can be applied to
Lady Macbeth and makes her ambition at once transparent to us. I
affirmed above that her lack of sexual feeling toward her husband
had its origin in the fact that she had loved her father too much
and could not therefore free herself from him. Her sexuality had
transformed itself into ambition and that, the ambition to be queen,<a name="FNanchor_39_40" href="#Footnote_39_40" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
in other words, the father's wife. So could she hold fast to the
infantile ideal and realize the forbidden incest. The intensity with
which she pursues the ambition of her life is explained then by the
glowing intensity of her sexual wishes.</p>

<p>With Shakespeare also king and father come together. A
remark of Lady Macbeth shows that when she addresses herself to
the murder of Duncan. &ldquo;Had he not resembled my father as he
slept, I had done't.&rdquo; This physical likeness signifies identity of individuals,
as we know from many analogous examples. The king
therefore resembles the father because he stands for her parent.
Still one more point may be well explained from her father complex.
The Chronicle speaks of the overweening ambition of Lady
Macbeth. Now we know from neuropsychology that burning ambition
in later years represents a reaction formation to infantile
bed wetting. It is the rule with such children that they are placed
upon the chamber at night by father or mother. Thus we comprehend
from another side, with the so frequent identification with
beloved persons, precisely why the lady wanders at night with a
candle in her hand. Here again appears plainly the return to the
infantile erotic.</p>

<p>Now for the grounds of her collapse. As long as Lady Macbeth
is fighting only for the childish goal, she is an unshakeable rock
amid the storms of danger. She shrinks from no wrong and no
crime that she may be queen at her husband's side. But she must
gradually perceive that her husband will never win satisfaction, he
will never recover from the king-father murder, her hopes will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129">129</a></span>never be fulfilled and she will never live in quiet satisfaction at the
side of her father. Then her power of endurance gives way until
her very soul fails utterly. As she says on the occasion of the first
disappointment after Duncan's death:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&ldquo;Nought's had, all's spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where our desire is got without content;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis safer to be that which we destroy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than, by destruction, dwell in doubtful joy.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now the unconscious, hitherto successfully repressed, avenges itself,
now conscience awakes and as the husband leaves her completely
alone she begins to wander, that is to seek to return to the infantile
ideal. In her wandering she herself plays the rôle of father, who
once approached her with the lighted candle and then called to her,
&ldquo;Come, come, come, come, give me your <ins title="hand!&rsquo;">hand!&rdquo;</ins> and bade her go
to bed.</p>

<p>Why however does not the ruthless Macbeth live down the murder
of the king as he does in the history? I believe that we must here
go still further back than to the Chronicle, even to the creator of
the tragedy himself. There is a certain important crisis in Shakespeare's
life, where according to the biography by George Brandes
&ldquo;cheerfulness, the very joy of life, was extinguished in his soul.
Heavy clouds gathered over his horizon, we now do not know just
what their source. Gnawing griefs and disappointments gathered
within him. We see his melancholy grow and extend itself; we
can observe the changing effects of this melancholy without clearly
recognizing its cause. Only we feel this, that the scene of action
which he sees with the inner eye of the soul has now become as
black as the external scene of which he makes use. A veil of phantasy
has sunk down over both. He writes no more comedies but
puts a succession of dark tragedies upon the stage, which lately reëchoed
to the laughter of his Rosalinds and Beatrices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This crisis came in the year 1601, when the earl of Essex and
Lord Southampton, Shakespeare's special patron, were condemned
to death because of treason against the life of the king. According
to Brandes the depression over their fate must have been one of the
original causes for the poet's beginning melancholy. Perhaps the
death of Shakespeare's father, which followed some months later,
made a more lasting impression with all the memories which it recalled.
The dramas which the poet published about that time, Julius
Cæsar, Hamlet and Macbeth, have a common theme, they all revolve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130">130</a></span>about a father murder. In &ldquo;Julius Cæsar,&rdquo; Brutus murders
his fatherly friend, his mother's beloved (&ldquo;And thou too, my son
Brutus?&rdquo;). Hamlet comes to shipwreck in his undertaking to
avenge upon his uncle the father's murder, because the uncle, as
Freud explains in his &ldquo;Interpretation of Dreams,&rdquo; had at bottom
done nothing else than Hamlet had wished in his childhood but had
not had the self confidence to carry out. And Macbeth in the last
analysis is ruined by the king and father murder, the results of
which he can never overcome. We may consider this theme of the
father murder, always presented in some new form, in the light of
its direct precipitating causes, the actual death of Shakespeare's
father and Southampton's treason against the ruling power of the
state. It is not difficult to accept that at that time the infantile
death wishes against his father were newly awakened in our poet
himself and were then projected externally in a series of powerful
dramas.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader, who has followed me more or less up to this
point, will stop here indignant: &ldquo;How could any one maintain that
a genius like Shakespeare could have wished to murder his father,
even if only in the phantasies of <ins title="childhood?">childhood?&rdquo;</ins> I can only reply to
this apparently justified indignation that the assumption I here make
concerning Shakespeare is fundamentally and universally human
and is true with every male child. We go for proof to what we
have earlier discovered, that the first inclination of every child, also
already erotically colored, belongs to the parent of the opposite sex,
the love of the girl to the father, the leaning of the boy to his
mother, while the child sets himself against the parent of the same
sex, who may be only justly concerned in his education without
over indulging him. The child would be most delighted to &ldquo;marry&rdquo;
the tender parent, as we heard above, and therefore feels that the
other parent stands in the way as a disturbing rival. &ldquo;If the little
boy,&rdquo; says Freud in the &ldquo;Interpretation of Dreams,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_40_41" href="#Footnote_40_41" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> &ldquo;is allowed
to sleep at his mother's side whenever his father goes on a journey,
and if after his father's return he must go back to the nursery to a
person whom he likes far less, the wish may be easily actuated that
his father may always be absent, in order that he may keep his place
next to his dear, beautiful mamma; and the father's death is obviously
a means for the attainment of this wish; for the child's
experience has taught him that &lsquo;dead&rsquo; folks, like grandpa, for
example, are always absent; they never return.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131">131</a></span>Yet how does the child reach such a depth of depravity as to
wish his parents dead? We may answer &ldquo;that the childish idea of
&lsquo;being dead&rsquo; has little else but the words in common with our own.
The child knows nothing of the horrors of decay, of shivering in the
cold grave, of the terror of the infinite Nothing.&hellip; Fear of death
is strange to the child, therefore it plays with the horrible word.&hellip;
Being dead means for the child, which has been spared the
scenes of suffering previous to dying, the same as &lsquo;being gone,&rsquo; not
disturbing the survivors any more. The child does not distinguish
the manner and means by which this absence is brought about,
whether by traveling, estrangement or death.&hellip; If, then, the
child has motives for wishing the absence of another child, every
restraint is lacking which would prevent it from clothing this wish
in the form that the child may die.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_41_42" href="#Footnote_41_42" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> It may be conjectured, if we
apply this to Shakespeare, that also this greatest of all dramatists
repeatedly during his childhood wished his father dead and that
this appeared in consciousness agitating him afresh at the actual
decease of the father and impelled him to those dramas which had
the father murder as their theme. Moreover the father's calling,
for he was not only a tanner but also a butcher, who stuck animals
with a knife, may have influenced the form of his death wishes as
well as of their later <ins title="reappearancess">reappearances</ins> in the great dramas.</p>

<p>The evil thoughts against the father in the child psyche by no
means exclude the fact that at the same time there are present with
them tender impulses, feelings of warmest love. This is indeed the
rule according to all experience and can be proved also with Shakespeare.
This other side of his childish impulse leads for example
to the powerful ambition which we find as a chief characteristic of
Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, as in truth of the poet himself. We
know that when the latter was a boy his father became bankrupt.
He had not only lost everything which he himself possessed, his
wife's dowry and his position as alderman, but was also so deeply
in debt at this time that he had to guard himself against arrest.
Once more I let Brandes express it: &ldquo;The object of Shakespeare's
desire was not in the first place either the calling of a poet or fame
as an actor, but wealth and that chiefly as a means for social advance.
He took very much to heart his father's decline in material
fortune and official respect. He held passionately from his youth
up to the purpose to reëstablish the name and the position of his
family.&hellip; His father had not dared to go along the streets, fearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132">132</a></span>to be arrested for debt. He himself as a young man had been
whipped at the command of the landowner and thrown into jail.
The small town which had been the witness of these humiliations
should be witness of the restoration of his honor. Where he had
been spoken of as the actor and playwright of doubtful fame, there
would he be seen again as the honored possessor of house and land.
There and elsewhere should the people, who had counted him among
the proletariat, learn to know him as a gentleman, that is as a member
of the lesser nobility.&hellip; In the year 1596 his father, apparently
at his instigation and with his support, entered a petition
at Heralds College for the bestowal of a coat of arms. The granting
of the coat of arms signified the ceremonial entry into the gentry.&rdquo;
The ambition of the small child is to become as great as the
father, and so later that of the man is to exalt the father himself,
to make him king. One sees how close and how very personal the
theme of ambition was to Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Before I go on to analyze further what the poet has woven into
his treatment of &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; from his own purely personal experience,
we must first consider a technical factor which is common
to all dramatists. It has been discovered that Shakespeare projected
his own complexes into his tragedies, complexes which are in no
way simple, but which show, for example, close to the hatred even
as great a love as well as other contrary elements. He is fond of
separating his dramatic projection into two personalities wherever
his feeling is an ambivalent one, these two forms standing in contrast
to one another. He splits his ego into two persons, each of
which corresponds to only one single emotional impulse. That is a
discovery which of course was not made for the first time by psychoanalysis.
Minor, for instance, writes in his book on Schiller: &ldquo;Only
in conjunction with Carlos does Posa represent Schiller's whole
nature, the wild passion of the one is the expression of the sensual
side, the noble exaltation of the other the stoical side of his nature.&hellip;
Schiller has not drawn this figure from external nature; it
has not come to him from without but he has taken it deep from his
inner being.&rdquo; Otto Ludwig expresses himself similarly: &ldquo;Goethe
often separates a man into two poetic forms, Faust-Mephisto, Clavigo-Carlos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is plainly to be seen, if we apply our recognition of this fact
to Shakespeare, that he has projected his ego affect into Macbeth
as well as his wife, which gives numerous advantages. So far we
have considered Lady Macbeth merely as a complete dramatic character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133">133</a></span>which she is first of all. Besides this nevertheless she surely
corresponds to a splitting of Shakespeare's affect, for the poet incorporates
in her his instincts for ruthless ambition. He has worked
over the character already given her by the Chronicle for his own
exculpation. It was stated previously that Macbeth in the first two
acts is by no means the bloodthirsty tyrant of Holinshed and really
stands far behind his wife in ambition. It is as if our poet, who
plainly stands behind his hero, wished thereby to say, I am not
capable of a father murder and would surely have put it off or not
have accomplished it at all, if I had not been compelled by a woman's
influence. Macbeth will go no further in the affair in spite of all
favorable outward circumstances, but it is Lady Macbeth who forces
the deed to completion. The final cause of every father hatred is
rivalry in regard to the mother and so it was she, represented by
Lady Macbeth, who in his phantasy would have urged the infantile
Shakespeare to put his father out of the way. Here branches out
another path for the sleep walking. We have so far spoken only
of the father who comes at night to the child, but now Lady Macbeth
walking in her sleep, seems also to represent Shakespeare's
mother, who with the candle in her hand convinces herself that her
darling child is sleeping soundly.<a name="FNanchor_42_43" href="#Footnote_42_43" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>It need not seem strange that I give a number of interpretations
apparently so fundamentally different for one and the same <ins title="thing,">thing.</ins>
There is nothing on earth more complicated than psychic things,
among which poetic creation belongs. Psychic phenomena are according
to all experience never simply built up nor simply grounded
but always brought together in manifold form. Whoever presses
deeply into them discovers behind every psychic manifestation without
exception an abundance of relationships and overdeterminations.
We are accustomed in the natural sciences to simple motivation, on
the one side cause, on the other effect. In the psychic life it is
quite otherwise. Only a superficial psychology is satisfied with
single causes. So manifold a chain of circumstances, those that lie
near at hand and those more remotely connected, come into play in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134">134</a></span>most, yes, apparently in all cases, that one scarcely has the right to
assert that a psychic phenomenon has been completely explained.
Dream analysis at once proves this. One can almost always rightfully
take it for granted that several, indeed manifold interpretations
are correct. It is best to think of a stratified structure. In
the most superficial layer lies the most obvious explanation, in the
second a somewhat more hidden one, and in yet deeper strata broader
and more remote relationships and all have their part more or less
in the manifested phenomenon. This latter is more or less well
motivated.</p>

<p>We now turn back to Shakespeare and observe the great depression
under which he labored just at the time when he created his
greatest tragedies. Does it seem too presumptuous to conceive that
one so shaken and dejected psychically should have slept badly and
even possibly&mdash;we know so little of his life&mdash;walked in his sleep?
The poet always hastened to repress<a name="FNanchor_43_44" href="#Footnote_43_44" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> whatever personal revelations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135">135</a></span>threatened to press through too plainly, as we know from many
proofs. The poverty of motivation quite unusual with Shakespeare,
just at the critical point of the sleep walking, seems to me to score
for such a repression. We might perhaps say that the fact that the
poet has introduced to such slight extent the wandering of Lady
Macbeth, has given it so little connection with what went before,
is due simply to this, that all sorts of most personal relationships
were too much involved to allow him to be more explicit. See
how Lady Macbeth comforted Macbeth directly after the frightful
deed, the king and father murder:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">&ldquo;Consider it not so deeply.<br /></span>
<span class="i10 spaced">. . . . . . . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i4">These deeds must not be thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After these ways; so, it will make us mad.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This must have referred to Shakespeare as much as to his hero.
Moreover the writing and sealing of the letter at the beginning of
the sleep walking described by the lady in waiting seems as if Lady
Macbeth had a secret, a confession to make&mdash;in the name of the poet.
I think also at the end, when the everlasting brooding over her deed
drives her to suicide, she dies as a substitute for her intellectual
creator, for his own self punishment.<a name="FNanchor_44_45" href="#Footnote_44_45" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>There remain yet only one or two points to be touched upon and
explained. No discussion is needed for the fact that an outspoken
sadistic nature in Lady Macbeth leads her to walk in her sleep,
indeed, disposes her to it. We can easily understand also that this
breaks forth just at the moment when her husband sets out, that is,
translated into the infantile, when Macbeth, or in the deeper layer
her own father, dies. It is much more necessary to explain why
immediately after the deed she has no scruples in staining the chamberlains
with Duncan's blood and takes the affair so lightly, while
later she is never rid of the fear of the blood and is always striving
in vain to wash her hands clean. Here it must be again recalled that
Lady Macbeth on the one hand represents the actual wife of Macbeth,
on the other hand the poet himself and in two epochs of his
life; Shakespeare first in his unrestrained striving and then when
he is brought low, shaken in his very depths by the death of his
father. Murder phantasies toward his father came to him as a boy
and then as a youth at the beginning of puberty, and yet at neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136">136</a></span>time was he ill. The more mature man however, borne down
more heavily by life, met by the actual death of his father, broke
down under the weight of things. This explains in the last analysis
the change in the attitude of Lady Macbeth.</p>

<p>I do not know how far the reader is willing to follow me. Yet
one thing I believe I have proved, that also in Lady Macbeth's sleep
walking the erotic is not wanting nor the regression into the infantile.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION AND RÉSUMÉ</h2>


<p>If now at the close of this book we bring together all our material,
we may with certainty or with the highest probability speak
of sleep walking and moon walking as follows:</p>

<ol id="conclusion">
<li><p>Sleep walking under or without the influence of the moon
represents a motor outbreak of the unconscious and serves, like the
dream, the fulfilment of secret, forbidden wishes, first of the present,
behind which however infantile wishes regularly hide. Both
prove themselves in all the cases analyzed more or less completely
as of a sexual erotic nature.</p></li>

<li><p>Those wishes also which present themselves without disguise
are mostly of the same nature. The leading wish may be claimed to
be that the sleep walker, male or female, would climb into bed with
the loved object as in childhood, which both the folk and the poet
well know. The love object need not belong necessarily to the present,
it can much more likely be one of earliest childhood.</p></li>

<li><p>Not infrequently the sleep walker identifies himself with the
beloved person, sometimes even puts on his clothes, linen or outer
garments, or imitates his manner to the life.</p></li>

<li><p>Sleep walking can also have an infantile prototype, when the
child pretends to be asleep in order that it may be able, without fear
of punishment, to experience all sorts of forbidden things, that is of
a sexual nature, because it cannot be held accountable for that which
it does &ldquo;unconsciously, in its sleep.&rdquo; The same motive of not being
held accountable actuates the adult sleep walker, who will satisfy
his sexual desires, yet without incurring guilt in so doing. The
same cause works also psychically, when sleep walking occurs
mostly in the very deepest sleep, even if organic causes are likewise
responsible for it.</p></li>

<li><p>The motor outbreak during sleep, which drives one from rest
in bed and results in sleep walking and wandering under the light
of the moon, may be referred to this, that all sleep walkers exhibit
a heightened muscular irritability and muscle erotic, the endogenous
excitement of which can compensate for the giving up of the rest
in bed. In accordance with this these phenomena are especially frequent
in the offspring of alcoholics, epileptics, sadists and hysterics
with preponderating involvement of the motor apparatus.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138">138</a></span>
Sleep walking and moon walking are in themselves as little
symptoms of hysteria as of epilepsy. Yet they are found frequently
in conjunction with the former.</p></li>

<li><p>The influence of the moon in this moon affectivity is very
little known, especially in its psychic overdetermination. Yet there
is little doubt that the moon's light is reminiscent of the light in the
hand of a beloved parent, who every night came in loving solicitude
to assure himself or herself of the child's sleep. Nothing so promptly
wakes the sleep walker as the calling of his name, which accords
with his being spoken to as a child by the parent. Fixed gazing
upon the planet also has probably an erotic coloring like the staring
of the hypnotizer to secure hypnosis. Other psychic overdeterminations
appear merely to fit individual cases. It is possible finally
that there actually exists a special power of attraction in the moon,
which may expressly force the moon walker out of his bed and
entice him to longer walks, but on this point we have no scientific
hypotheses.</p></li>

<li><p>Furthermore it seems possible that sleep walking and moon
walking may be permanently cured through Freud's psychoanalytic
method.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know very well that this explanation which I give here, offers
only the first beginning of an understanding. It will be the task of
a future, which we hope is not too far distant, to comprehend fully
these puzzling phenomena.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" href="#FNanchor_8_8" class="label">[8]</a> I have here given word for word what the patient wrote down. When
I then pointed out to her the evident contradiction, that she had misplaced
something into the seventeenth year, which according to an earlier statement
must have happened in the eleventh year, she answered that here
was in fact an earlier mistake, since her <ins title="brothr">brother</ins>-in-law Emil had first taken
breakfast with her mother in her seventeenth year. The facts were these:
She had walked a great deal in her sleep from her eleventh to her seventeenth
year, for her mother had always suffered from hemoptysis, with occasional
intermissions, and on this account had a nurse at various times. She had in
fact at eleven years done everything which she has described above, only the
making of the coffee for the brother-in-law happened in the seventeenth year.
Besides, all the other actions performed in sleep are correctly given. On
being questioned, she stated that her menses occurred first between her thirteenth
and fourteenth years and at the time of menstruation particularly she
had walked a great deal. She was always very much excited sexually before
her period, slept very restlessly and had always at that time arisen in her
sleep. Blood always excited her excessively sexually, as has been already
mentioned in the text. I will add just at this place that her exact dates,
when an event appears in the very first years of her life, must be taken with
a grain of salt, because falsification of memory is always to be found there.
This, however, is not of great importance because the facts are authentically
correct and at least agree approximately with the times specified, as I have
convinced myself through questioning her relatives.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" href="#FNanchor_9_9" class="label">[9]</a> <i>E.&nbsp;g.</i>, &ldquo;A monk of a melancholy disposition and known to be a sleep
walker, betook himself one evening to the room of his prior, who, as it happened,
had not yet gone to bed, but sat at his work table. The monk had a
knife in his hand, his eyes were open and without swerving he made straight
at the bed of the prior without looking at him or the light burning in the
room. He felt in the bed for the body, stuck it three times with the knife
and turned with a satisfied countenance back to his cell, the door of which
he closed. In the morning he told the horrified prior that he had dreamed
that the latter had murdered his mother, and that her bloody shadow had
appeared to him to summon him to avenge her. He had hastened to arise
and had stabbed the prior. Immediately he had awakened in his bed, bathed
in perspiration, and had thanked God that it had been only a frightful dream.
The monk was horrified when the prior told him what had taken place.&rdquo; The
following cases besides: &ldquo;A shoemaker's apprentice, tortured for a long time
with jealousy, climbed in his sleep over the roof to his beloved, stabbed her
and went back to bed.&rdquo; Another, &ldquo;A sleep walker in Naples stabbed his wife
because of an idea in a dream that she was untrue to him!&rdquo; We may conclude,
on the ground of our analytical experiences, that the untrue maiden
always represents the mother of the sleep walker, who has been faithless to
him with the father. The hatred thoughts toward this rival lead in the first
dream to the reverse Hamlet motive, the mother has demanded that the son
take revenge upon the father. Finally Krafft-Ebing gives still other cases:
&ldquo;A pastor, who would have been removed from his post on account of the
pregnancy of a girl, was acquitted because he proved that he was a sleep
walker and made it appear that in this condition&nbsp;(?) the forbidden relationship
had taken place.&rdquo; Also, &ldquo;The case of a girl who was sexually mishandled
in the somnambulistic condition. Only in the attacks had she consciousness
of having submitted to sexual relations, but not in the free
intervals.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_21" href="#FNanchor_20_21" class="label">[20]</a> According to my psychoanalytic experience children who cling so to
inanimate things see in them either sexual symbols or those things were once
objects of their secret sexual enjoyment. It may happen, for example, that
such a child falls in love with the furniture, the walls of the room, yes, even
a closet, stays there by the hour, kisses the walls, tells them its joys and sorrows
and hangs them with all sorts of pictures. One very often sees children
talking with inanimate things. They are embarrassed and break off at once
if surprised by their elders. If there were not something forbidden behind
this, there would be no ground for denying what they are doing, the more
so since in fairy tales beasts, plants and also inanimate things speak with mankind
and with one another without the child taking offense at it. The latter
first becomes confused by the same action when he is pilfering from the tree
of knowledge and has something sexual to hide. Hug-Hellmuth has convincingly
demonstrated the erotic connection of the child's enthusiasm for
plants as well as the different synesthesias. (See her study, &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Über Farbenhören</span>,&rdquo;

much less, if she wished to comfort him. And yet this passage is always
quoted by those authors who accept love on the part of Lady Macbeth for
her husband as the driving motive for her action. Indeed, Friedrich Theodor
Vischer himself does not shrink from an interpolation and translates the passage:
Lady Macbeth (&ldquo;caressingly&rdquo;)&mdash;&ldquo;Come, come, my noble lord, remove
thy wrinkles, smooth thy gloomy brow, be jovial this evening, well-disposed
toward thy guests.&rdquo; And although the original English text contains no word
for &ldquo;caressingly,&rdquo; yet Vischer gives this commentary: &ldquo;His wife's answer
to him must be spoken on the stage with an altogether tender accent. She
embraces him and strokes his forehead.&rdquo; (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Shakespeare-Vorträge</span>, Vol.&nbsp;2,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_43" href="#FNanchor_42_43" class="label">[42]</a> Going back into Shakespeare's own life gives further illumination and
foundation for Lady Macbeth's behavior in the sleep walking scene. The
reader may already have secretly thought that those little tendernesses on the
part of ordinary parents hardly enter into consideration in the case of a
thane's daughter. It may be said in answer to this that Shakespeare often,
as in the presentation of ancient scenes, put without scruple the environment
of his own time in place of the historical setting. And according to the above
he would be quite likely to utilize with Lady Macbeth recollections from the
Stratford childhood.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_44" href="#FNanchor_43_44" class="label">[43]</a> Otto Rank in his book, &ldquo;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Inzest-Motiv in Dichtung und Sage</span>,&rdquo;
furnishes a beautiful and convincing example of such repression: It comes
from a second drama based on a king's murder, &ldquo;Julius Cæsar.&rdquo; I quote
from the author's words: &ldquo;A heightened significance and at the same time an
incontrovertible conclusiveness is given to our whole conception and interpretation
of the son relationship of Brutus to Cæsar by the circumstance that in
the historical source, which Shakespeare evidently used and which he followed
almost word for word, namely in Plutarch, it is shown that Cæsar considered
Brutus his illegitimate son. In this sense Cæsar's outcry, which has become
a catch-word, may be understood, which he may have uttered again and again
when he saw Brutus pressing upon his body with drawn sword, &lsquo;And you
too my son Brutus?&rsquo; With Shakespeare the wounded Cæsar merely calls
out, <ins title="&ldquo;Et">&lsquo;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et</span></ins><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"> tu Brute!</span> Then fall, <ins title="Cæsar!&rdquo;">Cæsar!&rsquo;</ins> Shakespeare has set aside this son
relationship of Brutus to Cæsar, though doubtless known to the poet, in his
working out of the traditional sources. Not only is there deep psychic
ground for the modifications to which the poet subjects the historical and
traditional circumstances and characters or the conceptions of his predecessor,
but also for the omissions from the sources. These originate from the repressive
tendency toward the exposure of impulses which work painfully and
which are restrained as a result of the repression, and this was doubtless the
case with Shakespeare in regard to his strongly affective father complex.&rdquo;
Rank has in the same work demonstrated that this father complex runs
through all of Shakespeare's dramatic work, from his first work, &ldquo;Titus
Andronicus,&rdquo; down to his very last tragedy. I cannot go into detail on this
important point for my task here is merely to explain Lady Macbeth's sleep
walking, but any one who is interested may find overwhelming abundance of
evidence in Rank's book on incest (Chapter&nbsp;6). It is not only that I have
introduced Shakespeare's strong father complex here to make comprehensible
Lady Macbeth's sleep walking, but his own chief complex stood affectively in
the foreground, and was worked out, at the same time, as Macbeth.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_45" href="#FNanchor_44_45" class="label">[44]</a> I also recall that it is in fact she who expresses Duncan's character as
father, &ldquo;Had he not so resembled my father.&hellip;&rdquo;</p></div>
